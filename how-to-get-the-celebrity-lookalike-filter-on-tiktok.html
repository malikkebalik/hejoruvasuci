It’s a topic of discussion that many will discuss from time to time — I’ve been told I look like McLovin from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Superbad</a> by more people than I’d like to admit. But perhaps you don’t know who your famous lookalike is yet and you’re curious to find out. Thankfully, a viral filter on <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a></strong> could give you the answers you seek, as it will tell you the three celebrities that it thinks look the most like you.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Hundreds of TikTokers have already posted viral videos that make use of the filter. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The viral trend</a> has seen some videos with scarily accurate results whilst others seem way off the mark. Rumors have spread that the filter was made with AI so therefore it is more of an accurate result, at least that’s what some TikTokers are claiming.</p><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=807 data-injectable=true>However, there’s no proof that it is using any kind of AI software. I can pretty much confirm that because it told me I look like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rihanna</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Styles</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicki Minaj</a>. Like I said, I’m just a McLovin clone who can’t even get a tan, but I’ll take the compliment. At the end of the day, it’s mostly something you’d use for a laugh; the accuracy of the filter cannot be vouched for. If you still want to use it to find out your own famous twins then read on.</p><p data-characters=58 data-current-count=58 data-injectable=false>The steps required to get access to the filter are simple:</p><h2 id=h-here-are-the-steps data-injectable=false>Here are the steps</h2><li>Open the TikTok App.</li><li>Head to the search, the magnifying glass in the top right when you’re on the home page.</li><li>Search for ‘top 3 celebrity lookalikes.’</li><li>Click on any video that uses the filter.</li><li>Tap on the filter, which should appear near the bottom, above the description. You’ll be taken to a page with all videos that have used the filter</li><li>Tap the red button at the bottom of the screen that reads ‘Use this effect’</li><p data-characters=557 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=false>Now you can rest easy knowing what three celebrities you look the most like. Simply record and see what you get, and if you’re not happy with the results you can go again and get a different result and pretend that it was your first take. Don’t forget to add some trending audio to your video (most doing this trend use the song “Missing You” by Zach Templar) and you may well have a viral video on your hands. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got to get back to trying to make this filter give me the three main cast members from Superbad.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8qbvWZquoZZeawW7Ax55knJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKWnn6CurbXKnmSfoZypsrN5zqdkraGbqbysew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
