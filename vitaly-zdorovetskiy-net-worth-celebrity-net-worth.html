Vitaly dressed up as a zombie and traveled to some of the poorest neighborhoods in Miami in order to scare random bystanders. By January 2015, the video had more than 30 million views.

Vitaly attempted to raise money for Martin to have his teeth fixed, and it raised about $10,000, but the fundraising campaign was canceled due to Vitaly's criminal history. However, Martin received numerous offers from surgeons to do the work for free, and he was able to get his teeth fixed after all.</p><p>In November 2015, Lionsgate acquired worldwide distribution rights for Natural Born Pranksters, a movie Vitaly did with his fellow YouTube pranksters <a href=# title="Roman Atwood Net Worth">Roman Atwood</a> and Dennis Roady.
