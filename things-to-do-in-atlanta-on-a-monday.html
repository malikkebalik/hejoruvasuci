You can also get this deal on Tuesday-Friday, but Monday is when we're hurting from the weekend. While a no-cost Swedish cafeteria breakfast served up by a furniture-in-a-box warehouse should, by most rational measure, sound like a&nbsp;<a href=#>one-way ticket to the Lockig</a>, the Atlantic Station icon delivers a decent morning meal that will fill you up without sending you into a personal Game of Thrones mid-commute. The cafeteria opens at 9:30 a.m., and breakfast ends at 11 a.m.</p><p class=story-text data-index=8><a href=#>IKEA</a>, Atlantic Station<br>441 16th St. NW<br>404-745-4532</p><p class=story-text data-index=9><b>Monday Night Brewing Tour</b></p><p class=story-text data-index=11>There is very clearly no better day in which to tour the popular brewery.

The weekly ping-pong tournament at&nbsp;<a href=#>the world's best-themed bar</a>, more formally known as Sister Louisa's Church of the Living Room and Ping-Pong Emporium, is perhaps the most rousing weekly table tennis event in Atlanta.

Like most bingo-friendly establishments, Pabst Blue Ribbon is available at a discounted price to help serious players get the most from their experience.

While in most cases, cultural norms dictate strip club avoidance so early in the week, Magic City Mondays are worthy of exemption. There is perhaps no event in Atlanta more impactful to its respective industry than Magic City Mondays are to hip-hop. Tastemakers, rising stars and icons share in the show with the DJ.
