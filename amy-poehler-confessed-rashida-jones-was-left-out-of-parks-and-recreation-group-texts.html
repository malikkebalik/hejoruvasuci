Eventually, Poehler admitted there was a group text Jones wasn’t in — but it was because they were trying to organize a surprise for Jones.</p><p id=par-7_26>However, Poehler did admit that there were other Parks and Rec chats that Jones wasn’t in, but it didn’t seem there were any hard feelings.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-cast-of-the-show-are-friends-in-real-life>The cast of the show are friends in real life</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_34>The cast of the show shares a <a href=#>close bond </a>in real life. Besides the friendship between Jones and Poehler, Leslie and Ben Wyatt, among other characters, end up getting married on the program.</p><p id=par-9_38>Even though they weren’t in love in real life, they had a close bond nonetheless. In 2019, the two disclosed that they both experienced butterflies in the scene where Ben proposes to Leslie during the show’s 10-year reunion.</p><p id=par-10_31>The actors reunited recently for a special “quarantine edition” episode of Parks and Recreation. It’s evident from the episode that they’ve maintained their close friendship since filming concluded five years ago.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-rashida-jones-left-the-show>Why Rashida Jones left the show</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_39>Many have wondered why Jones wanted to <a href=#>leave the show</a>. As it turns out, Jones wants to move away from acting after years on Parks and Recreation and focus more on the writing and production side of entertainment.</p><p id=par-12_28>She had received several offers on the production side of the industry at the time, but she didn’t have time to pursue them all while filming the show.</p><p id=par-13_17>Another reason for her departure from the show is that her character was actually written out.</p><p id=par-14_26>Michael Schur, the show’s executive producer, told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HuffPost</a> in 2019 that he had always expected Perkins and Traeger to leave at some time. He said,</p><p>“We had the idea creatively to sort of move in that direction and it totally dovetailed and aligned with what the two actors envisioned for themselves in their careers. So it’s a big, happy, mutual hug-fest celebration.”</p><p id=par-15_33>Even though the show has concluded, it’s clear that the mutual love and respect that the actors shared lives on. The show was a success even though it had a shaky start.</p><p id=par-16_30>Despite being on the verge of being canceled several times due to low ratings, Parks and Recreation was able to reach its intended finale and conclude on its own terms.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-17_26>Being on the show has clearly resulted in some life-long friendships between members of the cast. As reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV Line</a>, director Michael Schur said,</p><p>“The chance to do it again, should it arise, would be incredible. But I think we’d only do it if we all felt like there was some compelling reason to do it. … [Each cast member] would have a veto. If one single person says, ‘No,’ we wouldn’t do it.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-18_25>This touching sign of solidarity is further proof that the cast and crew shared a unique bond that did indeed bleed over into real life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSursWMqaaeoJyav26vzqednqujmrFuvsCsn6KckWK3sLrErGSlnZaperDB02amn2Wglr%2Bsv4yapZ1lopqws7HAraCopl2cv7DBz2arnrCkqHupwMylZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
