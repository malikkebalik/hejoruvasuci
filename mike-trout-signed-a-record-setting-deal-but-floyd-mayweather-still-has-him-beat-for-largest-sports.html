And it was: Trout's $430 million contract is the largest guaranteed deal in professional sports. It'll likely keep him in L.A. for the rest of his career, and he'll obviously be set for life.&nbsp;</span><span style=font-weight:400>But dig a little deeper and you'll see that, technically, Trout's contract isn't the largest of all time. That honor belongs to <a href=# rel=noopener>Floyd Mayweather</a>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mayweather signed a deal with Showtime in 2013 for six fights and 30 months. Though the value of the deal was never released publicly, the contract paid the boxer an estimated $450 million.&nbsp;</span><span style=font-weight:400>That's an average of $75 million per fight, thanks largely to Mayweather's promoter skills. So why do most people not consider Mayweather's the largest deal ever?</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-279790 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-814580026.jpg alt width=900 height=506 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-279790 class=wp-caption-text>Matthew Lewis/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It's all in the guarantees. When Mayweather inked his deal with Showtime, he wasn't even guaranteed half of his total earnings. The contract was worth $200 million. Trout's deal is worth $430 million, regardless of how he performs on the field.&nbsp;</span><span style=font-weight:400>After massive paydays from bouts with <a href=# rel=noopener>Canelo Alvarez</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Manny Pacquiao</a>, Mayweather upped his total deal earnings to $450 million.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Showtime contract proved to be a large chunk of Mayweather's career earnings. The boxer is one of just three professional athletes to make at least $1 billion in on-field earnings. <a href=# rel=noopener>Michael Jordan</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Tiger Woods</a> are the others.&nbsp;</span><span style=font-weight:400>Trout, meanwhile, has a ways to go to earn a billion dollars. This latest deal will push his career earnings to an estimated $515 million.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It turns out "Money" Mayweather is a rather appropriate nickname, after all.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqagpJ1dqb%2BwwdNmqqKfnpqxbq2Mq5ycp6KZerSx062gp59dmbKiuIybrK1llqG8urCMppiyr5WWwamx0WaqraGcoXqprdJmn6KlXZeyosCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
