These seven simple <a href=# class=T3D>recipes from judge Jacques Torres</a> are perfect for anyone looking to indulge their sweet tooth — as long as you're a fan of chocolate.</p><h2>1. Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2><p>Torres is well-known for perfecting the gooey, melty chocolate chip cookie. His trick is to layer in high-quality chocolate disks instead of sprinkling in chips. As the chef once told Forbes, the difference lies in <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the chocolate's cocoa butter content</a>. "You want a cookie where the chocolate actually melts during the baking, which means the chocolate is high in cocoa butter and the mouthfeel is so much better," he explained. Find the recipe <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>here</a>.</p><h2>2. Dark Chocolate Bark</h2><p>This one requires only three ingredients that you may already have on-hand, and it's relatively healthy. All you need is one cup of dark chocolate disks, roasted pumpkin and sunflower seeds, and almonds. Find the recipe <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>here</a>.</p><h2>3. Chocolate Mudslide Cookies</h2><p>There are only three steps to this recipe. Well, four if you include eating them. Find the recipe <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>here</a>.</p><h2>4. Legendary Hot Chocolate</h2><p>Swiss Miss who? This frothy, rich hot chocolate recipe will make you forget those tiny marshmallows ever existed. Find the recipe <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>here</a>.</p><h2>5. Chocolate Mousse</h2><p>This fluffy delight is heavy whipping cream and melted chocolate combined. Just whip it up...literally. Find the recipe <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>here</a>.</p><h2>6. Cake Mix Soufflé</h2><p>This is exactly what it sounds like: a Torres recipe that combines store-bought cake mix with a bit of orange liquor to make it a little more gourmet. It's also baked in ramekins, so everyone gets their own personal-sized mini cake. Find the recipe <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>here</a>.</p><h2>7. Caramel Popcorn</h2><p></p><p>If the title made you think this was a chocolate-free recipe, you thought wrong. Torres' caramel popcorn features his staple dark chocolate disks, too. But the star of the show is warm, homemade caramel. Find the recipe <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>here</a>.</p><p>And remember, regardless of your skill level or how the final product turns out, it's OK to fail, as Torres would say.
