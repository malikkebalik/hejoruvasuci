Though he was known most for his role as Captain Von Trapp in the 1965 movie, The Sound of Music, the Candian-born actor had countless other roles across his career that expanded six decades.</p><p id=par-2_18>With many accolades and contributions to the acting world, his legacy will withstand the test of time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Christopher-Plummer.jpg><h2 id=h-christopher-plummer-did-not-want-to-be-an-actor>Christopher Plummer did not want to be an actor</h2><p id=par-3_54>A career in acting was not originally the renowned actor’s calling. Initally, Plummer studied music. He told <a href=#>Playbill</a>, “I thought seriously of becoming a concert pianist.” However, Plummer soon realized that working as a pianist would not give him the life he desired. He thought that it&nbsp;“was very lonely and very hard work.”</p><p id=par-4_40>Instead, Plummer shifted his mindset and found love on the stage. He was discovered by an English producer and director, Eva Le Gallienne. She helped him earn a role in 1954’s&nbsp;The Starcross Story&nbsp;with Mary Astor in New York City.</p><p id=par-5_55>Though The Starcross Story only consisted of one performance, the actor quickly became a legend in the New York City theatre scene. Plummer won his first Tony Award nomination for the play&nbsp;J.B.,&nbsp;and later, he earned an Emmy Award nomination for his work on the television show&nbsp;Hallmark Hall of Fame&nbsp;with the episode “Little Moon of Alban.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-christopher-plummer-did-not-want-to-be-in-the-sound-of-music>Christopher Plummer did not want to be in ‘The Sound of Music’</h2><p id=par-6_54>Still, Plummer’s massive debut did not come until 1965’s The Sound of Music. The beloved film is set against the Nazi occupation of Austria and follows Captain Von Trapp, a surly man who eventually falls in love with Maria, (Julie Andrews), a young nun who is hired to care for his seven children.</p><p id=par-7_55>Though it would become the role of a lifetime, Plummer had no interest in starring in the film at first. “I had become a pampered, arrogant young bastard, spoiled by too many great theatre roles,” he revealed in his 2008 memoir In Spite of Myself. “I still harbored the old-fashioned stage actor’s snobbism toward moviemaking.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-christopher-plummer-s-net-worth-was-20-million-when-he-died>Christopher Plummer’s net worth was $20 million when he died</h2><p id=par-8_52>According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, with such an expansive career that stretched across the decades, Plummer died with at least a $20 million net worth. In addition to films like The Sound of Music and most recently Knives Out, Plummer’s net worth came from his roles on the Broadway stage.</p><p id=par-9_56>He won Tony Awards for his work in&nbsp;Cyrano&nbsp;(1973) and&nbsp;Barrymore&nbsp;(1997). Plummer finally won an Academy Award as a supporting actor for the 2010 film&nbsp;Beginners. When the late actor finally held his Oscar in his hand he said, “You’re only two years older than me, darling. Where have you been all my life?” via <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>.</p><p id=par-10_21>Plummer was born in 1929.
