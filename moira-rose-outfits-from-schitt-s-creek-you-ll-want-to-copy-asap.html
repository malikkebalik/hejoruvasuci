But it is, arguably, <a href=# class=T3D>Moira Rose's style on Schitt's Creek</a> that takes the cake when it comes to looks that wow.</p><p>Though all four of the <a href=# class=T3D>main characters</a> grapple with their newfound reality, pulled away from their previous lavish lifestyle, it’s Moira whose style remains largely unchanged. It's just as elevated as you can imagine it was during a time when her schedule was packed with ladies lunches, cocktail parties, and spa treatments.</p><p>Moira’s closet consists of mostly black—with some white mixed in. And when she deviated from that color palette — wearing a nude-colored red carpet gown — there was a specific hidden meaning behind that style choice.</p><p>Her style walks the fine line between tailored and edgy and, of course, her wig collection is seemingly endless. She layers like a pro, be it with bodysuits, skinny leather pants and tunics, or jewels upon jewels. Though it’s truly impossible to narrow down her collection of couture looks to just a few, you can find some of her best looks of all three seasons below.</p><p>There’s no time like Fall to attempt to incorporate Moira's signature looks into your wardrobe. Scroll through some of her most memorable outfits below.</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">1</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Amish Country</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Netflix/Schitt's Creek</p></figure><p>When Moira headed to Amish Country to retrieve David, she wore what the character likely considered conservative—even if, in reality, it was the exact opposite.</p><p>In a tiered dress from Lanvin for H&M, a bodysuit, leather fingerless gloves from Chanel and a top hat, the only thing to make her all-black look even more jaw-dropping was the pair of large fishnet Proenza Schouler tights that she slipped into last.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">2</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Cabaret</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Netflix/Schitt's Creek</p></figure><p>When performing season 5’s cabaret finale, Moira channeled Liza Minnelli wearing a pair of high-waisted sequin-striped black pants and a halter vest. She aptly chose a black bob wig and topped it with a small black hat.</p><p>It was, as it turns out, the first time that O’Hara had exposed her arms and shoulders in any of the show’s costumes thus far.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">3</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Movie Premiere</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Netflix/Schitt's Creek</p></figure><p>Moira steps back into her old life for a moment, during the premiere of her movie <i>The Crows Have Eyes 3</i>, wearing a pale pink embellished gown with feathers from Pamella Roland. And the look had a hidden meaning behind it.</p><p>It was one of the few exceptions in the show’s entirety that the character wasn’t wearing head-to-toe black and that was for a very specific reason. The change in color made the untouchable Moira seem a bit more vulnerable, if only for a moment.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">4</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Layering Like a Pro</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Netflix/Schitt's Creek</p></figure><p>Moira always dressed in layers, and this look was one of the best iterations. She layered a black-and-white asymmetrical Proenza Schouler tunic over a bodysuit and slim leather pants, slipping into black leather booties that seemed a seamless extension of her legs.</p><p>She looked edgy and cool but also completely overdressed for her current lifestyle, as always.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">5</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">PVC Dress</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Netflix/Schitt's Creek</p></figure><p>For a photoshoot in a field, Moira dons a white button-down shirt with a black strapless ankle-length dress made of PVC. It’s designed by Raf Simons and, according to an interview Dan Levy gave with <i><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Vogue</a>, </i>“took us, I’m not going to lie, an hour to figure out how to put on.”</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">6</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Brunch Look</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Netflix/Schitt's Creek</p></figure><p>When the family heads to brunch, Moira opts for a pair of black culottes with a wide waist belt, button-down shirt, and long fringe vest on top. But, of course, she doesn’t stop there.</p><p>Her necklaces are layered to perfection, and she has two full hands of rings, and matching cuffs that are layered <i>on top</i> of her shirt at each wrist.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">7</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Babysitting</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Netflix/Schitt's Creek</p></figure><p>For her babysitting gig, Moira dresses as anyone would — right?

Even though she’s wearing a little black dress for her anniversary dinner with Johnny, her jewelry is layered, and shoes are truly jaw-dropping.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">9</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Lunch Date</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Netflix/Schitt's Creek</p></figure><p>During a lunch date with her daughter, Alexis, to discuss a potential social media takeover in honor of the premiere of <i>The Crows Have Eyes</i>, she wears a look that has now become early afternoon wear.</p><p>Moira slips into a mid-length fringe skirt made completely of silver sequins from MSGM, which she tops with a black military-style tailcoat from Alexander McQueen.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">10</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">The Final Look</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Netflix/Schitt's Creek</p></figure><p>As we bid adieu to Moira Rose and her chic family in the series finale, titled “Happy Ending,” the farewell of Johnny, Moira, David, and Alexis is a true tear-jerker—for both cast as well as viewer. And it is for that tearful family hug that Moira chooses a look that can't be topped.</p><p>She is wearing a head-to-toe black buffalo check Altuzzara suit that is statement-making yet tailored. For an added Moira-esque head-turner, however, her black blouse is tied in a gigantic bow right at the front of her neck.</p></figure><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC%2F07KjnmedpLazrYyrpqydXaiwqbXTrapmm6Kasqx5xZqqoaGfo3qwwdOfoK2r</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
