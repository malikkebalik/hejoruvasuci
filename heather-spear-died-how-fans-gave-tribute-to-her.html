We are beyond devastated and no amount of words will do justice to that. Heather was a bright spot in an otherwise bleak existence. Her infectious hilarity and radiant beauty made everyone she met fall in love with her.</p><p>She was a wonderful person who loved unconditionally, forgave easily and saw the best in everyone and every circumstance. So many people’s lives were impacted by Heather who played an integral role in the <a href=# rel=noopener>Food Lion family.</a></p><p>Madison and Bella’s father, Brian, as well as Heather’s parents, Pat and Rusty, brother Sean and sister-in-law, Alisha, grandmother, Spear, numerous aunts, uncles and cousins and best friend, Amber, survive her. It takes a village and Heather had a big one. Therefore, we are asking for donations to this Go Fund Me page in the hopes of relieving some of the financial burdens her family is experiencing as a result of her untimely and unexpected passing.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>5: I was so proud of our community raising a memorial to <a href=# rel=noopener>#ForceK6</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>#IndianContingent</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>#RIASC</a> in Kingussie recently, spear-headed by Heather Lawrie Taylor through ARC Kingussie. <a href=# rel=noopener>@cairngormsnews</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@StrathyHerald</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rMEihJlNcj</a></p><p>— Merryn Glover (@MerrynGlover) <a href=# rel=noopener>October 15, 2022</a></p><p>Madison and Bella will be able to focus on their grief without worrying about day-to-day expenses like food and housing thanks to these funds, which will also help cover the final costs for the family.</p><p>You can read about these latest news updates also</p><h2>How fans showed their love for Heather Spear?</h2><p>At this point, I am at a loss for words. I’ve spent the entire day trying to avoid making this post in the expectation that one day I would awake and realize it had all been a nightmare… Someone I’ve known and loved since the fourth grade was murdered the day before yesterday. My broken heart simply can’t take any more.</p><p>My first close friend in fourth grade was a girl named Heather and we met soon after moving to <a href=# rel=noopener>Wilmington, North Carolina</a> from another city. From the start, she was a lovely and compassionate person, a bundle of energy, and the owner of the widest, most beautiful and most genuine grin. I used to ride my bike there to meet up with Heather and our mutual friend Harper. Numerous sleepovers and birthday parties survive junior high and high school and maintain contact into adulthood altogether.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Looking for fiction, poetry, and academic work about malls/department stores. Kit Dobson's "Malled" is a good example, as well as Hendrix's "Horrorstör" and Heather Spear's poetry about West Edmonton Mall. Other suggestions? Anything with a dept store/mall component.</p><p>— Jes Battis (@jesbattis) <a href=# rel=noopener>November 5, 2020</a></p><p>I had this vision of us all living to a ripe old age sharing in each other’s joys and sorrows and witnessing the comings of the age of each other’s offspring. This discomfort in my chest is excruciating… One of my closest friends for many years passed away tragically as a result of the all-too-common phenomenon of domestic violence.</p><p>As someone who has been through domestic violence, I am shaken to my very core. One could say that this one is a little too close to home. I feel terrible for Heather’s family which includes her mother, father, brother, and children. I feel terrible for them. When one considers how brief and unexpected life can be, she deserved so much better. Heather, how I long to hold you again in my arms as I do in this photograph.</p><p>No, Heather, I don’t think I did. I wish I could help you out, Heather but I just don’t. This is such a shocking and heartbreaking turn of events that I’m pleading with everyone on my timeline to pray for Heather’s family. I’m at a loss for words, Heather.</p><p><strong>Final Lines</strong></p><p>Heather Michelle Spear, 36 was killed in a senseless act of domestic violence on Wednesday, November 30.
