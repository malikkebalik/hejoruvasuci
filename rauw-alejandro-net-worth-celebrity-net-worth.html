That was the dream — to be a famous fútbol player. But everything was against me because the country didn't help me fully develop. I got to a moment where I'm 20 and I had to ask myself, 'What am I doing?' I didn't see a huge future in it. I decided to get into music as a hobby. Doing it as fun, next thing you know I'm in it.</strong>"</p><h2 id=music-career><strong>Music Career</strong></h2><p>In 2014, Rauw began sharing music through SoundCloud.
