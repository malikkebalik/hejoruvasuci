Emily’s wheels are turning – it looks like she may be working on some sort of idea.</p><p>Toby shows up at Spencer’s house and is freaking out – he demands to know why Caleb would hurt Yvonne like that.

It’s a Rosewood cop. Apparently someone witnessed a girl matching Aria’s description leaving the 2 Crows Diner right after the phone call to Charlotte was made. Aria insists that she was never at the diner, but they take her down to the police station to stand in a line-up to see if the witness can pick her out. Aria sees someone leaving the police station that looks an awful lot like Sara Harvey, after the line-up, Lt. Tanner says that Aria is free to go, “for now.” Aria sneaks a peek of the witness’s statement on the Lieutenant’s desk and the girl that was seen at the diner was holding car keys with pin dice on them.</p><p>Meanwhile, Emily is doing some investigating of her own. She heads to the Rosewood Garage and asks the mechanics about the truck – they refuse to answer any of the questions.

Spencer is running late, she is at her house having a screaming match with her dad about Caleb. She screams at her dad that he has no right to judge Caleb for leaking a story, because his daughter Melissa covered up a murder. Spencer’s dad reveals that Melissa had nothing to do with Charlotte’s death – he tells Spencer that she was blackmailed by someone and she came to Rosewood to drop off money so they wouldn’t spill her secret. After she dropped off the money, Charlotte was murdered, so she got scared and left town.</p><p>Spencer arrives at Hanna’s party late and fills the liars in on what her dad told her about Melissa. At the party they are trying to play a game – and the sound system goes haywire and angry rock music starts blasting. Suddenly the lights turn off and the central air turns on in overdrive. Papers and giftwrap start flying everywhere, and somehow a fire is started in the middle of the livingroom. They manage to get everything undercontrol and the fire put out, Aria is burnt and taken to the hospital. Spencer is convinced Mona had something to do with the disaster since she was at the party.</p><p>Spencer gets a text message from Toby asking her to meet up and she makes up an excuse and rushes out of the party.

While they are waiting for the test results – Toby and Spencer get in a fight over whether or not they would keep the baby, and what their futures hold.</p><p>Spencer arrives at the Brew, Toby is waiting for her. Spencer tells Toby that Caleb didn’t leak Yvonne’s story, she spills the beans about the new “A” blackmailing them about Charlotte’s murder. Spencer gets emotional and apologizes for what happened to Yvonne – she mentions her and Toby’s pregnancy scare. Toby reassures her that his new girlfriend Yvonne is just as strong as she is – and she is going to be just fine.</p><p>Ezra visits Aria in the hospital – she gets emotional and tells Ezra that she doesn’t think it was an accident. When Ezra starts prying, Aria changes her story and says that she was just standing too close to the fire place. Liam barges in to the hospital room and interrupts their talk – he announces that he has good news for both of them, he just talked to their boss and everything is official, Aria and Ezra’s joint book was approved.</p><p>Emily is leaving the party with Mona, she notices that she has pink dice on her keychain. She asks Mona if she is the one that called Charlotte form the diner. Mona gets nervous and says she can’t talk about it.
