Anthony Cumia is best known for being one of co-hosts of the provocative "Opie and Anthony" radio show, which aired from 1995 to 2014.

After being fired, Anthony began an audio and video podcast called "The Anthony Cumia Show," which has aired ever since.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Anthony Cumia was born on April 26th of 1961 in Queens, New York.
