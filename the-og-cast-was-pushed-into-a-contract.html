The Lifetime series developed a cult following and introduced scores of people to the world of competitive dance. Furthermore, many of the cast members <a href=#>became famous in their own right</a>, garnering millions of fans around the world. However, the original cast members never expected the show to blow up, let alone change their lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dance-moms-was-originally-supposed-to-be-a-docuseries>‘Dance Moms’ was originally supposed to be a docuseries</h2><p id=par-2_69>Dance Moms spanned eight seasons and a whopping 224 episodes. However, the original premise for the show was only supposed to be six weeks. In fact, the show wasn’t initially pitched to the cast as a show, but rather a documentary series. In a conversation with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmopolitan</a>, Melissa Gisoni (mom to <a href=#>Maddie Ziegler</a> and Kenzie Ziegler) talked about the casting process for the initial docuseries.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Melissa Gisoni revealed how she, Maddie Ziegler, and Kenzie Ziegler got cast on the reality TV show</h2><p id=par-3_79>“We had to talk on tapes, kind of embellish a little, and say, ‘Oh, my daughter is the best,’ which is not something I’d normally say,” Gisoni revealed. “Then we had to send in a bunch of dance videos. It was supposed to be a documentary for six weeks, of them just following the dancers and their moms.&nbsp;I didn’t think it was a reality show. I didn’t even know what a reality show was then. I never watched any.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Gisoni reveals that the original ‘Dance Moms’ cast was pushed into signing contracts</h2><p id=par-4_69>Eventually, Gisoni learned that she and her daughters had been selected for the show. <a href=#>Dr. Holly Hatcher-Frazier</a>, Christi Lukasiak, and Kelly Hyland had also been cast from her studio. According to the moms, the Dance Moms producers presented them with contracts in the final hour. However, since they didn’t expect anyone would watch the show or for it to continue past the six-week mark, they signed the contracts.</p><p id=par-5_44>“We were kind of pushed into the contract —&nbsp;like if you don’t sign today, you can’t be on the show,” Gisoni recalled. “I was like, ‘Oh, OK. I’ll sign it. What’s the big deal?'” So we signed a contract when it was called&nbsp;Just Dance.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The concept of ‘Dance Moms’ began after the cast was already under contract</h2><p id=par-6_52>Of course, things drastically changed when the producers realized what a big personality <a href=#>Abby Lee Miller </a>was. Sensing the inherent drama that the dance teacher caused, the producers pivoted. The show shifted to focus on the contentious relationship between the moms and Miller. Soon after, it was rebranded as Dance Moms.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_76>It didn’t take long for the executives at Lifetime to fall in love with the premise of Dance Moms. They <a href=#>immediately order additional episodes</a> of the show, and the cast went on the road to nationals. Since they were locked under contract, it took a while before they were able to quit the show. And while Gisoni doesn’t necessarily regret her time on the show, she admits that she never wants to be on TV again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxorrCnmSmp52oerCzjJyYrKxdpcK0tMSdZKKmpKR6pLvNramam6RjtbW5y2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
