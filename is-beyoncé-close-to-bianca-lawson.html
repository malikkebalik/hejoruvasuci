The songstress stepped on to the scene in the late ’90s with her hit R&B group Destiny’s Child. From there, she has only soared. The Lemonade singer forged a powerhouse solo career for herself with 2003’s Dangerously In Love, and the rest is history.</p><p id=par-2_84>Though Queen Bey is one of the most visible people on the planet, she has managed to continue having a personal and private life outside of the spotlight. Though we’ve seen her out and about with her oldest daughter, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Blue Ivy (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Blue Ivy</a>. Her almost 3-year-old twins, Sir and Rumi have rarely been seen. Likewise, the songstress has spoken openly about her love for her mom, Tina Knowles-Lawson, sister, Solange Knowles, and husband, Jay-Z but she has still managed to keep some things to herself.</p><p id=par-3_31>Still,<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" Beyoncé (opens in a new tab)"> Beyoncé </a>and Solange aren’t the only famous women in the Knowles/Carter/Lawson clan. The “Savage (Remix)” singer’s step-sister is veteran actress Bianca Lawson. Here’s what we know about their relationship.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-1></figure><h2>Beyoncé’s mom is married to Bianca Lawson’s dad</h2><p id=par-4_44>Beyoncé’s mom, Tina Knowles-Lawson had known Bianca Lawson’s dad, actor Richard Lawson for years, as she was best friends with his late sister. After the former hair and wardrobe stylist ended her 31-year marriage with Matthew Knowles, she and the Poltergeist actor reconnected.</p><p id=par-5_73>“When I went through my divorce, I decided that I was going to pray this time for someone, then God sent me someone,” Knowles-Lawson told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Essence Magazine (opens in a new tab)">Essence Magazine</a>. “I prayed for the specific qualities I wanted in a man and I wasn’t going to settle for anything less. I really didn’t even know what I wanted, so you have to spend some time to try to find out what that is. Plus he’s fine!”</p><p id=par-6_88>Though the pair dated for some time, it was Knowles-Lawson’s granddaughter, Blue Ivy Carter who finally encouraged them to tie the knot. “[In September] we went on a boat with Beyoncé and Jay-Z for her birthday, and when we came out one night dressed to go to dinner, Blue said, ‘Oh, ya’ll look beautiful. When are ya’ll getting married?'”&nbsp;Knowles-Lawson told&nbsp;<a href=#>People</a> in April 2015. “Richard said, ‘Oh, Blue, soon. Do you approve?’ And she said yes,” Tina added. “That’s the first time we talked seriously about getting married.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><h2>Bianca Lawson has an expansive Hollywood career</h2><p id=par-7_35>Both Knowles-Lawson and Richard Lawson have adult children.
