For reference, a regular room at Saratoga Springs costs closer to 10 points (or $450) a night.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=slide-title-text>The Treehouse Villas are secluded in a wooded area separate from the main resort.</h2></p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>We were able to make our way around the resort pretty easily. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Megan duBois</span></span></figure><p>I tried to do online check-in, but my family and I didn't receive a text. We were able to go to the Carriage House lobby building at Saratoga Springs to chat with an employee, and to our surprise, our room was ready early, around 1:00 p.m.</p><p>To get into the Treehouse Villa area, we had to drive a short distance away from the main resort to an unmanned gate and press a button for someone to let us in for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon driving in, I was surprised at how lush the area was with trees. It really felt like being out in the woods.&nbsp;</p><p>Finding our assigned tree house was challenging at first, but we made it there without too much trouble.</p><p><h2 class=slide-title-text>The location is great if you have a car.</h2></p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>The resort grounds were beautiful. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Megan duBois</span></span></figure><p>I loved that the tree houses were in a wooded area near Saratoga Springs but still felt like a whole different hotel.</p><p>The one downfall to the location is transportation. To get to the theme parks without a personal vehicle, you have to take an internal shuttle to the main resort area, then transfer to a park bus.&nbsp;</p><p>Because we had a car, we were able to just drive ourselves around. But there was only one parking spot available per tree house.</p><p>For a villa that sleeps up to nine people, that can be a big challenge. But luckily, ours was located near the pool, which had additional parking.</p><p>There's also a dock where you can catch the boat to Disney Springs. The boat drops off and picks up guests near Rainforest Cafe. If you don't have a car, I think the boats were pretty quick and reliable.</p><p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Our villa was cute and perfectly themed for the outdoors.</h2></p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>There were lots of wooden details. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Megan duBois</span></span></figure><p>Our Treehouse Villa was clean and cozy, with a partial pool view and plenty of trees surrounding the structure.&nbsp;</p><p>The entryway to the tree house had river-rock-style tile, which opened up to a massive living room, dining area, and kitchen.</p><p>The common space had floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked the trees.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=slide-title-text>We found everything we needed in the kitchen.</h2></p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>There's a full kitchen in the villa. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Megan duBois</span></span></figure><p>The kitchen was well-equipped with a full-sized refrigerator, oven, microwave, sink, dishwasher, and coffee maker.</p><p>There were also plenty of plates, cups, silverware, pots, and pans for all of our cooking needs.</p><p>Unlike the more traditional hotels at Disney World, the Treehouse Villas are meant to be like vacation homes where you cook many of your meals.&nbsp;</p><p>We were able to cook breakfast all three mornings we were there. Lunch was mostly snacks that we brought from home, but we went to Wine Bar George (my favorite <a href=# rel data-analytics-module=body_link>restaurant at Disney World</a>) one day via the Disney Springs boat.&nbsp;</p><p>My family also cooked dinner two out of three nights. The other night we went to Jiko at <a href=# rel data-analytics-module=body_link>Animal Kingdom Lodge</a> for a fancy night out.</p><p><h2 class=slide-title-text>We could socialize and sleep in the living room.</h2></p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>The couches pulled out into beds. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Megan duBois</span></span></figure><p><a href=# rel data-analytics-module=body_link>The living room</a> was spacious with a large couch and cozy chair, both of which pulled out into beds.</p><p>There was also a second chair, but it didn't transform into a sleeping space.</p><p>The TV in the living room was big, and we watched plenty of Mickey Mouse cartoons in our pajamas each morning.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=slide-title-text>The second bedroom had a queen bed.</h2></p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>There are three different bedrooms in the villa. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Megan duBois</span></span></figure><p>Down the hallway was the second bedroom, which had a queen-sized bed, a set of drawers, and a small closet.</p><p>There was also a large TV in the room.</p><p><h2 class=slide-title-text>The hall bathroom was spacious enough.</h2></p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>There's one bathroom in the hallway and another in the main bedroom. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Megan duBois</span></span></figure><p>In the hallway with the first two rooms was a bathroom, which had a single vanity, a toilet, and a combination shower/tub.</p><p>Tubs are hard to find at newer Disney hotels, where glass-encased showers are the trend, but we appreciated it because we were traveling with a 2-year-old.&nbsp;</p><p>The hallway was also where the full-sized washer and dryer were located. We used it often since we played in the pool and went to <a href=# rel data-analytics-module=body_link>Disney's Typhoon Lagoon water park</a> one day.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=slide-title-text>The main bedroom was the most spacious.</h2></p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>All the bedrooms had their own TVs. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Megan duBois</span></span></figure><p>On the other side of the Treehouse Villa was the main bedroom, which had a queen-sized bed, a TV, a desk, a set of drawers, and a huge bathroom.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=slide-title-text>The main bathroom also had a combination shower/tub.</h2></p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>The bathtub was really nice. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Megan duBois</span></span></figure><p>The bathroom attached to the main bedroom had a single vanity, a toilet closet, and a unique shower set up.</p><p>The shower had a glass door, and a river-rock-style tile, but also included a large whirlpool tub inside.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=slide-title-text>We spent a lot of time on the deck.</h2></p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>The deck was very spacious. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Megan duBois</span></span></figure><p>Since the villas are up on pedestals, there was a flight of stairs that led up to the actual building and the attached deck.</p><p>We spent a lot of time out on the deck, which had a small table and four outside chairs. It was a great staging area for tongs, a spatula, and trays for food when we grilled.</p><p>The deck overlooked the woods. But it wasn't super quiet in the morning and afternoon because our tree house was close to a bus stop.</p><p><h2 class=slide-title-text>The pool was nice but nothing special.</h2></p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>We didn't have much of a problem with crowds at the pool. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Megan duBois</span></span></figure><p>The pool at the Treehouse Villas was nice. When we went it wasn't crowded, but it filled up when people returned from the theme parks in the late afternoon.</p><p>There was also a hot tub — which seemed to be the popular spot each night — and plenty of loungers and tables.&nbsp;</p><p>There's no slide or lifeguard at the pool, which may be a dealbreaker for some guests with kids. But Treehouse Villa guests can also use the pools at Saratoga Springs, which offer those amenities.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=slide-title-text>It was a great way to spend a weekend at Disney World.</h2></p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>The experience was very different from other Disney resorts. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Megan duBois</span></span></figure><p>My parents, two best friends, and a 2-year-old loved our time at the Treehouse Villas.</p><p>The overall vibe and amenities — undesirable parking situation aside — made it a birthday weekend well spent.&nbsp;</p><p>I definitely plan on staying here again knowing how fun it was. Plus, it was a great value it was since we used our DVC points.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufony1vtiipaBlpKeypnnHqKysnV2rtq24wKxkmqxdmba0usSyZLCnoqGxbsPOq6uhZZmpenN8kWtkcQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
