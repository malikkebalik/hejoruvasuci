Kurt Cobain), I’m well acquainted with Dave Grohl. Actually, not so much, but whenever I hear about him or see him in an interview, I always like him. He seems like a really funny, down-to-earth guy. A few years after Nirvana died with Kurt Cobain, Grohl started up Foo Fighters, this time with himself as the lead singer. After hanging tough with withering criticism that Foo Fighters were nowhere near as good as Nirvana, Grohl and his bandmates went on to become extremely successful and popular. Grohl even has side projects with Queens of the Stone Age, Nine Inch Nails and Probot, amongst others.</p><p>I didn’t know much about Grohl’s personal life, other than it in no way resembled Kurt Cobain’s. After his first marriage ended in 1997, Grohl settled down with Jordyn Blum sometime in 2001-2002. The couple married in 2003, and they welcomed their first child together in 2006, a daughter they named Violet Maye. Dave and Jordyn just welcomed their second child on April 17, another little girl. They named her Harper Willow. Nice.</p><p>Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl, 40, and his wife Jordyn Blum, 32, welcomed their second daughter on April 17, the singer announced in a statement.</p><p>Harper Willow Grohl is named after Grohl’s great uncle Harper Bonebrake and, according to dad, is “7 lbs. 8 oz., 20-inches long and loud as hell.”</p><p>Harper joins 3-year-old big sister Violet Maye, who will hopefully influence her new sibling’s taste in music.</p><p>“Violet loves the Amy Winehouse record,” he told PEOPLE last fall. “It’s all about the ‘Rehab’ song. If she hears ‘Try to make me go to rehab,’ Violet will go, ‘No no no.’ I know, it’s a little weird, but it’s really cute!”</p><p>[From <a href=#>People Magazine</a>]</p><p>That’s interesting that Harper is a family name – whenever I hear it, I always think that somebody’s parents were obsessed with To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee. It’s also really cute that Violet loves Amy Winehouse. In past interviews, Dave has said that Violet also loves The Beatles (who doesn’t?) and Mozart.</p><p>Congratulations to Dave, Jordyn and their two girls! It’s Dave’s lot in life to be surrounded by women!</p><p>Here are Dave and Jordyn at Music Cares man of the year dinner honoring Neil Diamond on February 6th.
