Thanks to the Green Bay Packers, we can get a pretty good idea of the dollars and cents that are in play in the NFL.</p><p>Since the Packers are a publicly owned company, they are required to file paperwork detailing the financial history of the team for&nbsp;the last year. The rest of the league&nbsp;–&nbsp;as they are&nbsp;privately owned entities&nbsp;–&nbsp;are not required to do so.</p><p>Well,&nbsp;the latest financial report for the Packers has been filed and made public. To say the numbers involved are staggering would be an understatement.</p><p>In regard to revenue, the Packers generated <strong>$375.7 million</strong>. It is a 16 percent increase over the previous season and ranks the Packers ninth in the league. Of that money, $226.4 million came courtesy of the team's share of the $7.24 billion that was generated last season (mostly thanks to the television contracts).</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-157169 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Green-Bay-Packers.jpg alt="Wesley Hitt/Getty Images" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-157169 class=wp-caption-text>Wesley Hitt/Getty Images</p><p>New deals kicked in with the networks last season that helped push the total up to $7.24 billion from the $6 billion the teams split the previous season. It's a pretty significant increase over the $3 billion the teams split in 2010.</p><p>Along with the $226.4 million, the Packers generated another $149.3 million on the local level – a number that becomes even more impressive when you consider there are only 104,000 people in the city of Green Bay, Wisconsin (and 312,000 in the metropolitan area).</p><p>What fans may find surprising is that of the $375 million in revenue, the team only made a little over $29 million in income; which&nbsp;is actually a 15 percent increase over the $25.3 million it made last year.</p><p>Not nearly as much as you would have thought, huh?</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-156578 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-51524900-2.jpg alt="Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images" width=900 height=590 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-156578 class=wp-caption-text>Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images</p><p>Part of the reason is because the team applied $28 million in depreciation related&nbsp;to the $312 million in stadium recently completed. Last year they applied only $8 million.</p><p>"At some point you've got to put the depreciation on the income statement," Paul Baniel, the team's vice president of finance said. "You take a 10-, 15-year term and kind of spread it out. This year's statements have about $28 million in depreciation. If we went back to (2012) I think that number would be under $10 (million)."</p><p>Revenue is only going to increase in the future. Thanks to the TV contracts, the national take is going to increase by 7-8 percent. The local revenue of $149.3 million was an increase of 9 percent from the year before due in large part to a doubling of the pro shop sales over the last year.</p><p>So&nbsp;–&nbsp;where does all the money go, since the team is technically publicly owned, but the money does not go to the shareholders. What is going to happen to the $29 million?</p><p>Apparently, the team has been buying up land around the stadium for the future development of what will be known as&nbsp;"Titletown." The recent stadium improvements have to be paid for and there are even more improvements on the horizon.</p><p>The team also has a reserve fund on hand&nbsp;–&nbsp;you know, just in case (currently $280 million).</p><p>While that is a lot of money, times weren't&nbsp;always so good for them. Back in 1992 the Packers had a bottom line of $860,818.&nbsp; The first time the team made $1 million in profit was in 1970 and the next time was in 1978. The first time they hit the $2 million mark was in 1985. Prior to the 2000 season, the largest yearly income was $6.7 million ('97 season).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqCpnp2eYq%2BixYypmJyjlafAbrPEp5yrmaSaerOxwqipnWVjbIJug4ymoKWkmaS7br7Er5ynrZVif3F9k2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
