But it seems like the actor now has a pretty famous person to help him: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tom Brady</strong></a>.</p><p>“Ben can be arrogant but Tom is somebody he absolutely looks up to and trusts completely,” an insider exclusively tells&nbsp;Closer Weekly. “Even though Tom is younger, he’s one of the few people Ben will listen to unconditionally and whose advice he’ll follow through on. Tom has proven to be a great influence on Ben during his recovery and it’s a mutually beneficial friendship,” they continued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Ben.jpg><p>The source added, “Tom keeps Ben close because he’ll need him to return the favor when he finally retires and contemplates his next steps in Los Angeles. As is, they live very close to one another and when Ben gets a text from Tom, his world stops and he cancels plans if it means he can have dinner with his sports idol.” The insider said, “And as crazy as it is, everybody around Ben understands why Tom has this effect on him — including Jennifer Garner!”</p><p>Well if you’re going to have a life coach, having the most recent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Bowl</a> champion, 41, isn’t a bad one at all. It also helps that the Good Will Hunting&nbsp;star, 46, is a huge Boston sports fan, and the quarterback of course plays for the New England Patriots. Although Ben’s son, Samuel, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">isn’t exactly all about it like his dad</a> is. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oscar</a> winner once shared a story on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jimmy Kimmel Live</a>&nbsp;that involved his young son, 6, telling him just that after listening to his father give a whole spiel about Boston sports history.</p><p>“… And he listens to me and then he stops and goes, ‘Dad, you’re from Boston. I’m from L.A.,’ and I had a full existential crisis,” the actor told the late night host. “‘I failed, I’m a bad father, this is a disaster, I don’t know what to do!’ There’s a <span id=IL_AD12 class=IL_AD>certain</span>&nbsp;sort of tragic pain that you carry with you as a person from Boston that you except to imbue to your&nbsp;<span id=IL_AD5 class=IL_AD>children</span>&nbsp;that they’re gonna carry on, like we suffer through the cold and the misery and lose big sporting events.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tom.jpg><p>But not to worry, because Ben had an idea to turn little Samuel into a fan, especially of the Pats. “I tell you what, I was going to put an end to that,” he joked, “because once my son starts telling me, ‘I’m from L.A.,’ I know some guys — a lot of guys from Boston in L.A. who do work in the trades, that kind of thing, trying to make it out here. So I got the New England discount — got some friends that were painters, carpenters, that kind of thing to do a little work in my son’s room and help him understand where he comes from. If not literally, then spiritually.”</p><p>We’re just eager to see how this friendship between Ben and his sports idol transpires.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46bnKdlkZuzrbHCpGSappRiwbC5jJupmpypYq6zsYynnLBlkpuztHnEsZqlraOew6Z7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
