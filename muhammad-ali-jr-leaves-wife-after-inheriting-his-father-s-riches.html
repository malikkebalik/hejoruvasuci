Boxing legend <a href=#><strong>Muhammad Ali</strong></a> was one of them. When Ali passed away on June 3, 2016, millions mourned his death, with his thousands of mourners paying their respects at the memorial service held for the late boxer in his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. Now, seven months after the death of one of the most legendary figures in sports, his family is again in the news for all of the wrong reasons.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>When Muhammad Ali died last year, he left his widow Lonnie $12 million, and&nbsp;each of his nine children $6 million each. Ali's only biologicsal son, Muhammad Ali Jr., who was reportedly living in Chicago relying on food stamps and hand outs and was estranged from his father at the time of his death, was one of the children who received a $6 million inheritance. Shortly after receiving the inheritance though, Ali Jr. reportedly skipped out on his wife, Shaakira, and their two young daughters, Ameera and Shakera.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-241492 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GettyImages-650513766.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-241492 class=wp-caption-text>Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Shaakira was "totally heartbroken" when Ali Jr. left their family after receiving the money, especially because, according to her, she was the breadwinner in the family prior to Ali's death. In the couple's 11 years of marriage, Shaakira stated that Ali Jr. never held a steady job, only doing odd jobs such as cutting grass for neighbors, and that she supported him throughout it all. The couple had been living in a cramped apartment owned by Shaakira's parents in South Side Chicago before Ali Jr. skipped out on the family.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Shaakira still lives in the Chicago apartment with her children, while Muhammad Jr.'s whereabouts are currently unknown.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqasoZmdoq6lecCloGaiomK5pq3Vnqpmr5mbsm61zaGcq6GknruoecWaq6Gdoqh6s7XCoZysZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
