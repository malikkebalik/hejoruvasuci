Erin Lindsay (Sophia Bush) talking to Dt. Jay Halstead (Jesse Lee Soffer) about his birthday plans; he invites her to a night out with the guys. In the middle of their meal they receive a call of a robbery in progress with shots fired.</p><p>They quickly drive over to the scene where witnesses reveal the suspects fled on dirt bikes. Inside the credit union, they find gunshot victims, one of guards has died. Jay calls for multiple EMS as Erin attends to one of the women who was shot. Sgt. Hank Voight (Jason Beghe) arrives and catches up on the incident ordering one of CPD’s officers to bag some evidence.</p><p>He is quickly interrupted by Dt. Hailey Upton (Tracy Spiridakos) from the robbery and homicide unit. She tells Voight she appreciates the help but this is now her scene; he protests saying his team recovered evidence and saved a woman’s life so he is running point. Upton says she has been after this crew for the last few weeks and Voight wants to know why his team responded first. She tells them to vacate her crime scene since she is ROBBERY and HOMICIDE.</p><p>Back at the precinct, the Intelligence Unit learn all the details of the robbery from Voight. Halstead spoke to a friend of his who was able to tell him where the cell jammer came from, showing them a photo of Jimmy Rickard who illegally imports the jammers from China, selling them at his electronic business to burglars.</p><p>Dt. Adam Ruzek (Patrick John Flueger) asks if there is any sort of pattern to the banks they are hitting, before Halstead can answer Dt. Upton enters the room with Sgt. Trudy Platt (Amy Morton) and Chief Lugo (Esai Morales) saying they are targeting Credit Unions that have a lot of cash on hand but less security than corporate branches. In the last few weeks they have hit 5 banks and stolen over half a million in cash.</p><p>Voight asks if Upton got lost on the way back to her precinct. She pushes past Platt, knocking her coffee all over her as she tells Voight he has a lot of balls taking her case. Lugo tells her that’s enough and he takes both Voight and Upton into his office. He listens to Voight’s pitch and tells Upton it is Intelligence’s case. She isn’t pleased saying she always heard Voight was a son of a bitch, and now she knows it is true. He smiles at her and asks for her files on the past robberies.</p><p>Dt. Alvin Olinsky (Elias Koteas) and Dt. Ruzek arrive at the electronic store asking Jimmy who he sold the jammers to. He says T-Rod came in a few days ago, he apparently runs a robbery crew on the south side. Olinsky asks him if he can fix his VCR and Ruzek tells him it is 2017 and the next time he gets his pay he is going to buy him a blu-ray player.</p><p>Halstead and Dt. Kevin Atwater (LaRoyce Hawkins) are parked outside Satin and Silk Gentlemen’s Club where they have confirmed T-Rod is inside. He has a long sheet of robberies and home invasions; Ruzek and Olinsky arrive and they enter the club. Olinsky arrests T-Rod while Atwater collects all the money.</p><p>In the interrogation room, he denies committing any bank robberies and Atwater calls Olinsky and Halstead out of the room. Erin reveals none of the money matches any of the robberies but it does match a home invasion that happens 5 days earlier and they used the cell jammer to block the security system in the house allowing them to steal $200K in cash. Voight tells them to bring in the victim to see if she can idenitfy T-Rod in a lineup.</p><p>Ruzek calls Voight into another room where he shows him a map of the 5 credit unions hit and the last 3 that he believes will be their next target. Voight tells them to split up into teams and check out the banks’ surveillance cameras and see if anyone is casing them.</p><p>As Halstead and Erin are looking at the cameras, the bank they are in has a robbery happening at the same time. Halstead calls for back up and they run into the bank shouting Chicago PD; Erin is able to shoot one of them. Two escape as the other two struggle to escape the scene. Erin warns the one to stop, he raises his gun to her and she shoots to kill, she removes his helmet revealing he was just a kid.</p><p>Halstead brings in the other one who couldn’t escape. Atwater and Voight question him, but he doesn’t talk. Voight shows him pictures of the people they have shot and his friend who is dead. He leans back and asks for a public defender and a juvenile advocate and he isn’t speaking until they arrive; revealing he is a young offender and will be out by the time he is 18. Voight sarcastically says that it seems he knows more than they do.</p><p>Olinsky reveals the boy in the interrogation room is 14-year-old Corey Jenkins (Terrell Ransom Jr.), a kid from Atwater’s hometown. There is a picture of Lavar Spann (Christopher B. Duncan) also in the file with handwriting on the back. Voight takes the photos and leaves.</p><p>The ME tells Erin and Halstead, the dead offender’s name is 14-year-old, Curtis Jace. His mother arrives and identifies her son, as Halstead introduces himself and Erin, she asks which one of them killed him. She cries out to Erin that she killed her child, asking what right she had to do that?</p><p>Upton arrives as per Voight’s request and Atwater escorts her upstairs. He tells her they have caught one of the robbers and she says they are working for Spann. She explains that Spann was an ex-robber from the west side, who did time in federal lock ups and the last heist he pulled he was shot in the back by an FBI agent, leaving him partially paralyzed; he was paroled a year ago.</p><p>She believes he has recruited kids from his old neighborhood to do the robberies for him, just like Fagin from Oliver Twist. Spann was released from prison because he was shot and used his settlement to buy a car lot; Voight says they need to hit that lot.</p><p>At the car lot, Voight tells his team to round up all the kids there while Upton and him go back to speak to Spann. Upton serves him with a warrant saying they have the right to search his business and all records found within. Ruzek questions the kids, handing them gang affiliation cards to fill out while Atwater takes their photos with his phone.</p><p>Inside, Voight shows Spann a picture of Corey, Spann says Corey was a good kid and wasn’t the type to rob a bank. Voight agrees implying someone put him up to it. Spann says he is trying to show these kids the right way with some discipline, offering them jobs instead of ending up on street corners. Upton believes the job skills he is teaching them is bank robbery.</p><p>Voight threatens that if he finds out he put these kids up to robbing banks he is going to come back there and it won’t be nearly as civil. Spann tells him if he is going to beat a cripple, he will sue like last time and make himself a fortune.</p><p>ASA Steve Kot (Chris Agos) is reluctant to give the IU warrants for Spann’s home and multiple vehicles, as there is no proof Spann conspired or orchestrated these crimes. Erin is positive he is making the kids do it for him and questions whether Kot is afraid Spann will file another law suit against them.</p><p>Kot turns to Erin saying she shot an African American teen who apparently didn’t ever fire his weapon. She is furious and asks if he has ever looked down the barrel of an automatic weapon before she storms out of his office. He tells Voight to show him a direct link between Spann and the robberies.</p><p>Voight tells the team they are going to do around the clock watch on Spann. Ruzek shares the criminal history on all the teens. Voight asks Upton if she wants in on the surveillance, she does. Halstead and Olinsky question Upton and how she rose in the ranks to become a detective. She shares she was undercover for a year but is under a gag order and if she talks, she will be fired.</p><p>Suddenly Sammy Ray (Chronicle Ganawah) arrives on his dirt bike and Upton wants to go after him but Olinsky says they are not chasing a bike around with the van. Atwater returns to the interrogation room when Corey’s lawyer arrives. She wants to know when they can get bail.</p><p>Atwater says he is up for armed robbery and murder and since he is already known for running from every foster home he has been in, he can guarantee he will be remanded to State’s custody. Corey begins to cry saying he never shot anyone, Atwater pounces on his vulnerability and he reveals that if anyone talks he will find a way to get to the snitch; his lawyer ends the conversation.</p><p>Erin reveals the results of the bullet casings. The partial fingerprints belong to brothers, Bobby and Darren Wilkes, both work at Spann’s car lot. Voight tells them to grab the brothers. Atwater tells Voight that Corey is scared out of his mind, Voight orders him to go back up Erin and Ruzek.</p><p>Erin and Atwater break into the house where the brothers are apparently squatting at. They search most of the house, and when they come to the back room where the music is blaring from, they find both brothers shot to death from a 12-gauge shotgun; Erin confirms its the Wilkes brothers. Ruzek is upset saying its just a couple of kids.</p><p>Erin posts a photo of the dead brothers on their board, saying this had to have been a hit and couldn’t have been more than 15 minutes before they got there; Atwater says they don’t know who the shooter is yet. Upton arrives saying Sammy Ray was on a pod cam a black away from the Wilkes brothers’ house and the neighbor saw Sammy run from the home and jump on his bike taking off like a bat out of hell. She reveals he is known for running errands for Spann. Voight asks they have a location and she gives him the address of Sammy’s girlfriend, Tana Pearson (Jasmine Grant). He orders the team to hit it and congratulates Upton on her good work.</p><p>They knock down the door at Tana’s house and arrest both of them. Atwater opens a paper bag and pulls out stacks of money.</p><p>Erin invites Upton to join her for an interview. Erin tells Sammy he is up for a “murder for hire” charge and he even though he is 17, he could be charged as an adult. She says they don’t need to go there if he will admit that Lavar Spann is the one who hired him to kill Bobby and Darren Wilkes.</p><p>Upton reveals they have his prints from an alcohol bottle at the murder scene and a witness who saw him flee. She tells him it looks like Spann set him up to take the fall. He recites exactly what Corey said earlier: He wants a public defender and a juvenile advocate and he isn’t speaking until they arrive.</p><p>Atwater returns to show Corey the photos of Bobby and Darren’s death scene; Corey continues to cry as Atwater said the guy who is supposedly looking out for him did it. Corey says they were promised to spend the summer at a beach in Michigan, which is great since some of the teens have never been outside of Chicago.</p><p>Atwater leans down to him, saying he can have that opportunity. Corey frets saying after what Spann has done, he won’t make it past next week. Atwater promises he won’t let that happen to him and he will protect him; he assures him he is no longer alone in this. Voight bows his head as he listens.</p><p>Atwater comes into the lunch room revealing that Corey agreed to give a statement with the juvenile advocate’s approval. He continues to share that he promised Corey they would take care of him, he looks to Voight saying they got Spann. Atwater asks Voight what the problem is?</p><p>Voight brings Corey down to the room where there is no cameras. He tells Corey if he gives a statement he will have to testify in open court against Spann and they both know what he is capable of. Voight admits he knows what Atwater said to him, but he cannot guarantee his safety. Voight asks Corey to trust him and to not open his mouth as it will end badly for him.</p><p>He tells Corey that by him showing he is willing to help them, that is all that matters. All of Corey’s friends are dying and Voight doesn’t want that for him. Voight encourages him to tell everyone he has changed his mind and to not say anything to anyone.</p><p>Voight meets with Mark Jefferies (Carl Weather), Kot and Chief Lugo revealing Corey Jenkins retracted his statement because he is scared. Voight says Lavar Spann is the larger target. He shows some photos of Spann distributing alcohol to minors, a clear violation of his parole.</p><p>Jefferies is furious but Chief Lugo says getting Spann off the streets for any amount of time is a win for him. Kot tells Voight to take another run at it. Voight says he was banging co-eds in law school while he was working the gang unit so he understands how this works. He says if Corey snitches he is dead, so his testimony is not an option.</p><p>Voight stands outside as the officers bring out a handcuffed Spann. Spann says he only will serve 18 months but Voight promises he will have a unit on him every second, waking him up and tucking him in and when he is released and spends even a single dollar of the bank robbery and he will see Voight again.</p><p>Sgt Platt brings Corey to the transfer van; Atwater tells him to keep his head down and get his GED. He tells him to make a plan and when he gets out Atwater and Voight will make something happen for him. Corey asks him if he is mad he didn’t make a statement. Atwater says he isn’t and understands why he didn’t.</p><p>Upton arrives at Voight’s office, he says he would like to give her the case back but he doesn’t feel there is much of a case left. She says she will be happy to type it up either way and takes the file. She acknowledges what he did for Corey, admitting she doesn’t know any cops who would have done that to protect the kid. Voight says he has an officer on furlough and offers her the spot if she wants it. She doesn’t give him an answer.</p><p>As she comes to the front desk she knows Platt doesn’t remember her. She says February 9, 2003 Platt answered a call at a diner, where a guy came in and pistol whipped the owner when he was closing up, almost killing him. All for $272.57; Platt remembers she was working robbery/homicide.</p><p>Upton says she didn’t meet Platt as a cop, but as a little girl. Platt remembers Upton was there, she was the owner’s daughter. Upton shares that she spent the whole night at Platt’s desk worried if her dad would live, but Platt made her feel safe. She tells Platt she became a cop because of her. When Upton leaves, Platt cries.</p><p>At Molly’s, everyone is celebrating Halstead’s birthday. Erin arrives with a very expensive bottle of alcohol, they pour some drinks but Erin says she isn’t having a drink, she is exhausted and tries to leave.</p><p>Jay Halstead asks if she is okay and she shakes her head. She is upset she killed a 14-year-old boy. Jay holds her tight and she leaves.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaHBnk522pK3GqGSpnF2nsqStz2ZsbGlnYsCmrdKopWZsXZq9qr%2FOnZxmamFis6KzyKdm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
