If you’ve been missing Selina Wu (Lydia Look), you’re in luck since she’ll return during the week of February 19-23.</p><p>Selina is a hit with many fans on social media since she always seems to have a few secrets and ulterior motives.</p><p>It’s fun to watch Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) try to navigate his alliance with Selina since he can’t fully trust her, but it’s in his best interest to keep a peaceful partnership in play.</p><p>It turns out Sonny and Selina will have a brainstorming session soon, so it sounds like they’ll discuss the mysterious threat that’s been targeting higher-ups in crime organizations.</p><p>Selina could be at risk just like Sonny, so they’ll have a meeting and strategize a bit.</p><p>We should also mention that Martin Grey (Michael E. Knight) recently left town, so it seems we can go ahead and call that his exit – at least for now.</p><p>As for Dex Heller (Evan Hofer), Sonny backed him into a corner and demanded his own departure from the canvas, but he apparently won’t be off-screen for long.</p><p>Hofer spoke to SOD about giving Steve Burton (Jason Morgan) a hug while they were both at work.</p><p>Since Burton didn’t begin filming until February 5 and won’t start airing again until March 4, it’s easy to connect the dots here and assume Dex will still be appearing in early March.</p><p>The show’s credits have also confirmed that Adam Harrington is on contract in the role of John “Jagger” Cates, so it sounds like he’ll be sticking around with substantial airtime.</p><p>Other <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital spoilers say Eva LaRue has been tapped to play Blaze’s (Jacqueline Grace Lopez) mom</a>, Natalia Rogers-Ramirez, so look for her to make her GH debut on February 26.</p><p>Blaze and Kristina Corinthos-Davis (Kate Mansi) have plenty of drama headed their way once Natalia’s plane lands in Port Charles, so stick with us for updates on all the chaos.</p><p>As more comings and goings news becomes available, we’ll pass along everything you need to know!</p><p>CDL’s where you want to be for fantastic <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital spoilers, news and updates, so make us your go-to GH source.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaW1nl5q7pr7ApWShp6OltrWty2aaqKWZo7S0ecaooKefo2K7psOMnKanrKKWsLV50aijnmWTpLuntdGmnJ1lo5q5qrrAZq6uZaKawba%2BzaxkoZ2imnqku8yeqmalkaKubrrArZiloZFk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
