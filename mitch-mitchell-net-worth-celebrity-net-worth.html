Born in 1947 in Greenwich, London, England, as John Ronald Mitchell, Mitch Mitchell got his first state of show business as a teenager, appearing in "Jennings and Derbyshire", a children's TV program. He continued acting during the early '60s, appearing in "Bottoms Up", and soon took an interest in music and, in particular, the drums. By 1962, he was touring with several bands, and, four years later, landed an audition with The <a href=# title="Jimi Hendrix Net Worth">Jimi Hendrix</a> Experience. Mitchell earned the part, becoming one of the most influential contributors to the band. He was with the group until the middle of 1969, though he did perform again in 1970.</p><p>Mitchell continued to work as a producer on several posthumous Hendrix recordings, including "Rainbow Bridge" and "The Cry of Love".
