It was also terrible in every imaginable way, and regularly finds itself named among the worst features Hollywood has ever had to offer, but it was the production that ended up doing the most long-term damage.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>For whatever reason, the call was made to shoot The Conqueror in and around nuclear testing sites in Utah, and while it hasn’t been scientifically proven or concerned, the statistics are alarming. 41 percent of the 220 people who worked on the movie developed some form of cancer, and more than half of that number ultimately passed away as a result, including Wayne.</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=false>The correlation is right there for all to see, and for it to happen in what’s roundly regarded as a horrendous work of cinema makes it easy to see why The Conqueror has ended up securing such an unwanted accolade.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKdlmaOzornOrqpmoJmowbC%2ByJyYpWWVpbakedOhmK1lkaG6sL%2FTZpqeqqSWtq%2B42GaioqScmrFuuc6rnGasmJa7bn6PZqafZZmpwG5%2BkWlkrKyipLuoecKrnLBlnpa6prCMrZ%2BeZaOeu6i4xGauqKqjqXqlscKiqqKnnmK2r3nCoqWepZFitaq%2F06ipsmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
