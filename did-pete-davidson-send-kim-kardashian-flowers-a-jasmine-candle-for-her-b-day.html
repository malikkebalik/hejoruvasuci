Most Angelenos prefer to fly though, especially the people with private planes. So it was for Kim Kardashian, who celebrated her 42nd birthday last Friday. Not only was she inundated with headlines about Taylor Swift – who conveniently dropped her album on Kim’s birthday – but Kim ended up having to cancel her big birthday plans in Las Vegas. She tried to fly out to Vegas with a group of friends and family to watch the Usher show and have a party at Carbone, but the winds in Nevada <a href=#>made it too dangerous for the plane to land</a>. She and her group flew back to LA and she celebrated her birthday at In-and-Out. She ended up posting this days later:</p><p>Thank you so much for the birthday wishes. This weekend I had an overwhelmingly beautiful amount of love from so many people reaching out and it really made me smile so much. The flowers, the dinner the almost Vegas trip all was so so special and I will remember this birthday forever</p><p><a href=#>[From Kim’s IG]</a></p><p>It’s a little bit funny. It was like Taylor Swift’s Revenge played out over the course of the day. But still, Kim got to eat fast food and hang out with her fam, so it was fine. As for those “flowers” Kim referenced, she posted a photo of all of the bouquets she received, and some people think that Pete Davidson sent her one of the bouquets. According to ET, they still talk:</p><p>No hard cutoffs for Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson. A source tells ET that the two still communicate despite their breakup in August.</p><p>“Pete and Kim still keep in touch,” the source says. “It wasn’t a bad fallout or breakup, so things are good between them and they’ve remained in contact.”</p><p>Fans also speculated online over the weekend that Pete had sent his ex flowers for her star-studded 42nd birthday party. Kim posted a photo of roses alongside a jasmin scented Diptyque candle to her Instagram Story, which fans believed to be a reference to the “Jasmine and Aladdin” Saturday Night Live sketch that originally introduced the couple in October 2021.</p><p><a href=#>[From ET]</a></p><p>I bet Pete did send her flowers and a candle. That’s thoughtful and nice. He clearly needed to get out of that relationship because of Kanye West’s harassment and bullying, not because Pete and Kim had some kind of falling out. I kind of wonder if we’ll get a Kim/Pete redux.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kim-kardashian-bday-flowers-pete.jpg alt width=460 sizes="(max-width: 798px) 100vw, 798px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BGUS_2492507_001.jpg alt width=480 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Backgrid, Kim’s IG.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcHFgZYJ2e8Oim5iolamyoLDAr6Cdq5%2BjrLSxzZ2WpKGdlLiivsOaqqGhkaOsp7jOsJyrq4%2BWrKut0qagp52PmK6vsMuelp%2BnopS1pr6%2Bm2Sdmalk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
