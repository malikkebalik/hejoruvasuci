He was born on March 14th of 1988 in Akron, Ohio. His father is <a href=#>Dell Curry</a>, a successful NBA player who was the all-time leading scorer for the Charlotte Hornets. He was also the top scorer of three-pointers for the Hornets, although his son would later take this achievement to a whole new level. While his father was playing for the Hornets, Curry lived in Charlotte, North Carolina. After Dell started playing for the Raptors, Stephen Curry moved to Toronto with the family.</p><p>While in Toronto, Stephen Curry attended Queensway Christian College and joined the basketball team. During this time, he led the team to an undefeated season. He also joined the Toronto 5-0, a team that played matches with other clubs across Ontario. Stephen Curry later won the provincial championship with the Toronto 5-0. After Dell retired from professional basketball, Curry moved back to Charlotte with the rest of the family and finished high school, leading his new team to three conference titles.</p><h2 id=college-basketball><strong>College Basketball</strong></h2><p>Although Stephen Curry wanted to follow in his father's footsteps and play for Virginia Tech, the school's basketball department was unsure about whether or not Curry could succeed with his small stature. In response, Curry attended Davidson College and played for the Wildcats. He started his college career strongly and soon became one of the NCAA's highest scorers. He also set new records for scoring three-pointers. In his second year, he won his first NCAA Tournament with the Wildcats.</p><p>Curry then spent his junior year developing as a point guard, since he knew that this would be his likely position in the NBA. He once again scored highly in games and increased his number of assists. He finished as the leading scorer in the NCAA.</p><h2 id=nba-career><strong>NBA Career</strong></h2><p>In 2009, Stephen Curry joined the Golden State Warriors. A strong second half of the season made him a contender for Rookie of the Year. By the end of the season, Curry had registered 166 points from three-pointers – the most of any rookie in NBA history. Next season, Curry established himself as a free-throw specialist and won the skills challenge during All-Star Weekend. During the next period, he struggled with issues related to his right ankle.</p><p>After signing a lucrative new contract with the Warriors in 2012, Curry finished the season with 272 completed three-pointers – a new record. Although critics stated the Warriors were unwise to sign a new contract with then-injury-prone Curry, he proved that he was a valuable member of the team. In the next season, Curry hit a whopping 314 three-pointers.</p><p>Starting in 2014, new head coach <a href=# title="Steve Kerr Net Worth">Steve Kerr</a> implemented a new tactic that involved moving the ball faster and giving Curry more freedom to shoot. This was the beginning of a revolutionary new type of basketball that emphasized three-pointers rather than physical play underneath the hoop. These tactics would later spread to other teams. During this time, Steve Kerr focused on building his team into a title-winning force, winning the championships in the 2014-2015 season.</p><p>Although Stephen Curry performed well over the next few seasons, inconsistencies caused by injuries prevented him from reaching his full potential. Things started to take shape in 2016 when the Warriors reached the finals with a record of 12-0 – a first in NBA history. They won the championship title that year and repeated the feat next year with another championship title. During the next few years, Stephen Curry continued to perform well, although injury to his left hand in 2020 required surgery and three months of rest. Curry returned to the court in March 2020 having not skipped a beat. And in 2021-2022 season, the Warriors went on their fourth championship run for which Curry won his first Finals MVP award.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Stephen Curry has been married to <a href=#>Ayesha Alexander</a> since 2011.
