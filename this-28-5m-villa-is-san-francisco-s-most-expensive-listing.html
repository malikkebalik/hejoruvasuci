In 2008, the luxury listing was the prestigious centerpiece of the San Francisco Decorators Showcase, which describes the home as a "stunning Italianate mansion."</p><p>If the prestigious honor bestowed upon it isn't enough to woo buyers, the beauty of the magnificently restored and modernized 1904 James A. McCullough villa just might do it.</p><p>Expert craftsmanship aside, the seven bedrooms, eight full bathrooms, three half bathrooms and slew of modern amenities packed inside this San Francisco stunner suggest that size is no doubt a major factor in the robust price tag.</p><p>At 16,000 square feet, this pricey piece of property comes with everything a homeowner could dream of – and more.</p><p></p><p>Beyond the comfortable living quarters for seven, the villa includes a formal dining room, a reception hall, six cast bronze balconies and a gated driveway complete with a four-car garage. If that isn't enough, it also comes with a library, seven fireplaces, a gym and a wine room.</p><p>Another jaw-dropping detail that is sure to attract attention is the home's mezzanine and its accompanying Tiffany glass skylight.</p><p>Still not sold? Prospective buyers are reminded that if what's inside the house doesn't do it for you, what's outside might. The Scott Street villa offers some exclusive panoramic views of both the Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge.</p><p>Additionally, the location of the upscale listing makes it ideal for city dwellers and those with families. The home is within walking distance of the Union Street shopping district, several well-known and prestigious school systems and multiple public transportation options.</p><p>While many high-end listings see an eventual drop in price, the same can't be said for this San Francisco home. 2820 Scott has been on the market for three years, originally pinned with a price tag of $24.8 million in 2013. Three years and $3.8 million dollars later, it stands to dominate luxury listing prices for the foreseeable future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLTOsGSmrZOdeqW7xKxmpqejqXqmxM%2Bepayhppp6qbvUrJxmq5Zk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
