Produced by CBC and hosted by Cree journalist Connie Walker, M&M consists of two seasons, the first concerning Alberta Williams, who was murdered along BC’s infamous “Highway of Tears” in 1989, and the second examining Cleo Semaganis Nicotine, a young Saskatchewanian who was scooped up by an American family and dropped into oblivion. Titled “Finding Cleo,” the second season concludes with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">host actually finding Cleo’s resting place</a> and solving a four-decade mystery, which is a very moving episode to start with.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>M&M has a 4.7 iTunes rating out of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">over 7,000 reviews</a>.

The mini-episode, “Larrisa Lone Hill” provides a good introduction to what the podcast is about. It can be heard on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple Podcasts</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Stolen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ezgif-1-650aa976a2-3-scaled.jpg><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=623 data-injectable=true>Connie Walker’s follow-up podcast, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stolen</a> also consists of two seasons, the first of which investigates Jermain Charlo, who disappeared from a Montana bar in 2018. The second season focuses on Walker’s father and other family members, who were victims of sexual abuse in the Canadian residential school system.</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>Stolen has been spotlighted by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MSNBC</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a>. Both seasons are very informative and allow the listener to get an important perspective on the real-life people impacted by this epidemic. It is best to start with the first episode of the podcast, as it provides much-needed information on Jermain Charlo.
