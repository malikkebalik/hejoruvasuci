Veronica Roth is best known for authoring the best-selling "Divergent" trilogy of young adult science-fiction books. The trilogy sold over 35 million copies worldwide and was adapted into a film series. Beyond "Divergent," Roth has written such books as "Carve the Mark," "Poster Girl," and "When Among Crows."</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Veronica Roth was born on August 19, 1988 in New York City and raised mostly in Barrington, Illinois. She is the youngest of three siblings. When Roth was five years old, her parents divorced, and her mother Barbara later remarried a financial consultant named Frank. Roth is of German and Polish descent, with her maternal grandparents being Holocaust survivors. However, she gravitated toward Christianity as a youth and attended a bible studies program during her years at Barrington High School. For her higher education, Roth attended Carleton College for one year before transferring to Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. There, she studied creative writing.</p><h2 id=divergent-series><strong>Divergent Series</strong></h2><p>While on winter break during her final year at Northwestern, Roth wrote her first book, "Divergent." Set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago, the dystopian science-fiction novel focuses on a society that categorizes its citizens according to a strict, personality-based system divided into five factions: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless, and Erudite. The protagonist, Beatrice Prior, begins rebelling against the system by exploring her new identity as "Tris." By March in her final quarter at Northwestern, Roth found an agent, and soon sold the publishing rights to "Divergent" before she graduated from college in 2010. The next year, she sold the film rights, and shortly after that "Divergent" was printed. Roth's career took off rapidly with the success of the novel, which became a bestseller. The first sequel, "Insurgent," came out in 2012, followed by the concluding chapter in the trilogy, "Allegiant," in 2013. Since their release, the novels have sold over 35 million copies worldwide.</p><p>With the film rights to the "Divergent" series sold to Summit Entertainment, the first film adaptation of the series was released in 2014. Directed by Neil Burger, and written by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor, the film introduced <a href=# title="Shailene Woodley Net Worth">Shailene Woodley</a> in the role of Tris.

"Insurgent" grossed a similar amount as its predecessor at the box office. The final book in the "Divergent" series, "Allegiant," was originally going to be divided into two films for its film adaptation: "Allegiant" and "Ascendant." However, after the first was a commercial disappointment upon its release in 2016, the second part was canceled.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-355492 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Veronica-Roth.jpg alt width=900 height=598 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-355492 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic)</p><h2 id=other-books><strong>Other Books</strong></h2><p>In early 2017, Roth published the young adult science-fiction novel "Carve the Mark" through HarperCollins.
