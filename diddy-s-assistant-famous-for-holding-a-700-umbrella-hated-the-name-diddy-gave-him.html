The wealthy artist is well connected, as he founded his own entertainment empire in the ’90s and remains relevant today. So, who was <a href=#>Diddy’s assistant</a>, Fonzworth Bentley, who held up Diddy’s $700 umbrella on rainy days? Here’s what to know — and why he hated the name Diddy gave him.</p><h2 id=h-why-is-diddy-so-famous-what-to-know-about-the-entrepreneur>Why is Diddy so famous? What to know about the entrepreneur</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Diddy-and-Fonzworth-Bentley.jpg><p id=par-2_66>Most music lovers <a href=#>know Diddy for his hip-hop beats</a>, but the entrepreneur had a number of ventures that assisted in his wealth. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Washington Post</a> notes much of <a href=#>Diddy’s $60 million in earnings</a> didn’t come from music at all. His businesses helped him greatly, and his famous name in music assisted in sales. His ventures include creating his own clothing, TV series, alcohol, cologne, and water.</p><p id=par-3_97>“I wanted to make the records that you woke up in the morning to,” Diddy told The Washington Post. “I wanted to make the clothes you got into after taking a shower. I wanted to make the cologne you put on after that, while you listened to more of my music while driving to your job. I wanted to make the water that you drink, Aquahyrdate, when you’re at the gym. And then when you’re back home, I want you to be able to turn on the TV and watch one of the television shows I produce.”</p><p id=par-4_30>Diddy also mentioned he doesn’t want to be famous for having a lot of money, but rather he wants to be known for giving that money away to good causes.</p><h2>Fonzworth Bentley, Diddy’s assistant famous for holding Diddy’s $700 umbrella, hated his nickname</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Fonzworth-Bentley.jpg><p id=par-5_69>Making millions of dollars in the entertainment industry is no easy feat, and Diddy’s assistant became famous for helping the hip-hop artist. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Boombox</a> reports Diddy was first seen with his assistant known as Fonzworth Bentley in 2005.

It was in Time, Newsweek, People. It made me famous overnight.”</p><p id=par-7_44>Diddy gave his assistant the name of Fonzworth Bentley, as his real name is Derek Watkins.
