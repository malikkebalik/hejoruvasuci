It’s likely you’ve seen the voice actor before.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-alison-brie-is-the-voice-actor-behind-planetina-in-rick-and-morty-season-5><strong>Alison Brie is the voice actor behind Planetina in ‘Rick and Morty’ Season 5</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Alison-Brie.jpg><p id=par-2_57><a href=#>Alison Brie</a> is the voice of Planetina in <a href=#>Rick and Morty Season 5 Episode 3</a>. The 38-year-old actor has been in a number of popular projects, including the Dan Harmon-created series Community. She was also cast in Netflix’s GLOW and AMC’s Mad Men. You may also recognize Brie’s voice because she played Diane Nguyen in BoJack Horseman.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_40>Meanwhile, Rick and Morty Season 5 Episode 3 included another famous guest star. Rick’s alien love interest, Daphne, was voiced by Jennifer Coolidge. The actor is known for her iconic roles on American Pie, Legally Blonde, and A Cinderella Story.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-happened-to-planetina-in-rick-and-morty-season-5-episode-3><strong>What happened to Planetina in ‘Rick and Morty’ Season 5 Episode 3?</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_38>Despite their hot and heavy start, Planetina and Morty didn’t exactly get their happily ever after in Rick and Morty Season 5 Episode 3. Morty was instantly drawn to the Captain Planet-inspired character. Then Planetina reciprocated his feelings.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_57>Nevertheless, Planetina and Morty experienced a few obstacles. <a href=#>Beth</a> wasn’t thrilled with the match, particularly because of their age difference. Morty also chose his new girlfriend over his family. Meanwhile, Planetina’s “kids” used her as a prop and sold her to someone overseas. In the end, Morty brutally murdered the Planetina’s captors so they could be together.</p><p id=par-6_49>That said, Planetina’s freedom came at a price. Eventually, the superhero took things too far and used violence to “save” the environment, even killing 300 people. So Morty broke up with Planetina, leaving both parties devastated and heartbroken. Then, in the end, Beth was the one to comfort Morty.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-planetina-episode-is-rick-and-morty-co-creator-dan-harmon-s-favorite><strong>The Planetina episode is ‘Rick and Morty’ co-creator Dan Harmon’s favorite</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_64>The end of Rick and Morty Season 5 Episode 3 hit many fans right in the feels. Meanwhile, it seems the new episode is one of Harmon’s favorites. When speaking with Decider ahead of the premiere, the co-creator opened up about “A Rickconvenient Mort,” which was written by Rob Schrab. Harmon even suggested that the episode could be submitted for an Emmy. He said:</p><p>This season there’s an episode where Morty stumbles into a relationship with a young lady who is sort of a Captain Planet archetype. She’s a superhero from the ‘90s who’s very eco-conscious. It’s a story about Morty having a relationship, which we’ve seen before in throwaway jokes and things. But it’s done with a particular amount of indie movie heart. … The early cuts that I’ve seen of it, I know it’s definitely my favorite. Maybe it’ll be the one that we submit for whatever things actually make TV important.</p><p id=par-8_11>Rick and Morty Season 5 airs Sunday nights on Adult Swim.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2Fqq%2FKZpinnF2ivLPA2GatqKGTmnqxuMCnnK2hnpZ6orjIrKanZZKntqZ5wJyrqKpencGuuI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
