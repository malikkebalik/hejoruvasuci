I haven‚Äôt watched it yet. I fully intend to, I simply haven‚Äôt gotten through the rest of my queue. The fact that Melanie is on the show only fortifies my determination to get it. I love her. I also love her constant beating of the drum about not commenting on her figure. Unfortunately, as much as Melanie continues to exist as a woman doing her job, people find ways to point out the fact that she is not a size two actress. The latest is the ex-Mrs. Peter Brady, Adrianne Curry, who took exception to Melanie on The Last of Us. Only the photo Adrianne used wasn‚Äôt from The Last of Us and it appeared as if she hadn‚Äôt actually watched the show, both of which Melanie pointed out:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Firstly- this is a photo from my cover shoot for InStyle magazine, not a still from HBO‚Äôs The Last Of Us. And I‚Äôm playing a person who meticulously planned & executed an overthrow of FEDRA. I am supposed to be SMART, ma‚Äôam. I don‚Äôt need to be muscly. That‚Äôs what henchmen are for <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YwkmkwUdOm</a></p><p>‚Äî Melanie Lynskey (@melanielynskey) <a href=#>February 8, 2023</a></p><p>[From Twitter via <a href=#>Pajiba</a>]</p><p><a href=#>I covered</a> that InStyle write up of Melanie and commented on how amazing she looked. So I‚Äôve already diverged from Adrianne‚Äôs nonsense. Secondly, as a person who honestly hasn‚Äôt seen the show, the term ‚Äòwarlord‚Äô in and of itself suggests the person calling the shots, so Adrianne negated her own comment. And lastly, why is she commenting on another woman‚Äôs body like this?! It‚Äôs mean and gross. WTF?!</p><p>Even though Melanie‚Äôs response was *chef‚Äôs kiss*, she wasn‚Äôt finished. And I get it. If some clout chaser was using me like this, I‚Äôd say my piece as well. So Melanie went back to Twitter and emptied the rest of the barrel:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Other than getting to work with creative geniuses who I respect and admire (Neil & Craig) the thing that excited me most about doing <a href=#>#TheLastOfUs</a> is that my casting suggested the possibility of a future in which people start listening to the person with the best ideas</p><p>‚Äî Melanie Lynskey (@melanielynskey) <a href=#>February 8, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Not the coolest or the toughest person. The organiser. The person who knows where everything is. The person who is doing the planning. The person who can multitask. The one who‚Äôs decisive</p><p>‚Äî Melanie Lynskey (@melanielynskey) <a href=#>February 8, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I was excited at the idea of playing a woman who had, in a desperate and tragic time, jumped into a role she had never planned on having and nobody else had planned on her having, and then she actually got shit done</p><p>‚Äî Melanie Lynskey (@melanielynskey) <a href=#>February 8, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I wanted her to look like she should have a notepad on her at all times. I wanted her to be feminine, and soft-voiced, and all the things that we‚Äôve been told are ‚Äúweak‚Äù. Because honestly, fuck that.</p><p>‚Äî Melanie Lynskey (@melanielynskey) <a href=#>February 8, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I‚Äôm so grateful to Craig and Neil for creating a truly new character. Someone I have never seen before. And for trusting me with her. And for letting me be on THE MOST AMAZING SHOW</p><p>‚Äî Melanie Lynskey (@melanielynskey) <a href=#>February 8, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>And I‚Äôm also grateful because the love and support I receive from you all is so overwhelming and powerful- I feel like we are a community and I feel very seen and loved. Ok rant over and thank you all so very much üíó</p><p>‚Äî Melanie Lynskey (@melanielynskey) <a href=#>February 8, 2023</a></p><p>I wish Melanie didn‚Äôt have to <a href=#>keep</a> <a href=#>saying</a> <a href=#>this</a>, that she wants to play a person who doesn‚Äôt have to address her weight. That she wants to show all shapes and sizes can portray all variety of characters. And for heaven‚Äôs sake can we stop saying Melanie is large? She‚Äôs not waif-like but honestly I, too, would love to see roles for women that had nothing to do with their appearance. So I‚Äôm excited to see Melanie in The Last of Us. And I am excited to never have to read anything Adrianne has to say again. Because there was no call for this, on any level. Even if Melanie put Adrianne in her place, this should have never been put out there. Adrianne can go mean-girl with her non-existent fans on TikTok where Dustin on Pajiba said <a href=#>in his brilliant write-up</a> that she‚Äôs an anti-trans a-hole. Good riddance.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/coverimages51961824-768x1024.jpg alt width=500 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/coverimages51887480-682x1024.jpg alt width=500 sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/coverimages51961835-683x1024.jpg alt width=500 sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photo credit: Instagram, Twitter and Cover images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcWhjboN2e8yeo5qmmZqsrcXNrKKesY%2BnsrS8zqebrJekpKykvsitoJyho6KssLK%2BoZyrl6SdsqC4wKyrmKeWlMK0q8KhmKuZk6mys7%2B%2Bm6yipJRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
