What is his estimated net worth?</p><p>Published on December 25, 2020</p><span></span><span>2 min read</span><p id=par-1_53>Actor Chris Pine stars in&nbsp;<a href=#>Wonder Woman 1984</a>, the 2020 sequel to the hit DCEU film. He’s spent more than a decade in the spotlight, meaning his net worth is undoubtedly high. Here’s a look at Pine’s past money-making roles, <a href=#>his estimated net worth</a>, and what he may have made for the superhero movie.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Chris Pine became famous for his role in the ‘Star Trek’ franchise</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-2_46>Pine began his career in the early ’00s. He acted in romantic comedies such as&nbsp;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&nbsp;and&nbsp;Just My Luck&nbsp;while making one-off TV appearances in series like&nbsp;ER&nbsp;and&nbsp;American Dreams. However, it was his breakout role in one sci-fi film that made him a household name.</p><p id=par-3_49>In 2009, Pine’s career-defining role as James T. Kirk in the <a href=#>rebooted&nbsp;Star Trek&nbsp;franchise</a> entry of the same name. The actor reprised his leading part in 2013’s&nbsp;Star Trek Into the Darkness&nbsp;and 2016’s&nbsp;Star Trek Beyond. For a generation of&nbsp;Star Trek&nbsp;fans, he became their Captain Kirk (the role originated by William Shatner).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>He starred in a handful of other films and TV shows</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-2 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/IAmTheNightTNT/status/1125856125822349318</p></figure><p id=par-4_39>Over the past decade-plus, Pine has continued to act in many popular films. He’s embraced the action genre, starring in&nbsp;Unstoppable,&nbsp;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, and&nbsp;The Finest Hours. Additionally, he’s remained a fixture in sci-fi with&nbsp;Z for Zachariah&nbsp;and&nbsp;A Wrinkle in Time.</p><p id=par-5_51>When it comes to the small screen, Pine has stuck to recurring arcs. He played Eric in&nbsp;Wet: Hot America Summer: First Day of Camp&nbsp;and&nbsp;Wet Hot America Summer: Ten Years Later. However, in 2019, he headlined his first series (albeit a limited one), starring in and executive producing TNT’s&nbsp;I Am the Night.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Pine portrayed Steve Trevor in ‘Wonder Woman’ and ‘Wonder Woman 1984’</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-6_55>While fellow Hollywood Chrises Pratt, Evans, and Hemsworth made their mark on the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Pine opted for a later arrival on the DC end of things. He portrayed Steve Trevor, a WWI fighter pilot, in <a href=#>2017’s&nbsp;Wonder Woman</a>.&nbsp;At the end of the film, he sacrifices himself so Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) can defeat Ares.</p><p id=par-7_50>So it was shocking to many fans to discover that, along with Gadot, Pine was set to return for the film’s sequel. Taking place decades after the first,&nbsp;Wonder Woman 1984&nbsp;debuted on Christmas Day 2020 in theaters and <a href=#>on HBO Max</a>. No spoilers here, but yes, Steve Trevor is indeed back.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Chris Pine’s net worth and ‘Wonder Woman 1984’ salary</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/chris-pine-wonder-woman-premiere.jpg><p id=par-8_50>Pine has made out well with past films. In 2012, a lawsuit revealed that he might have earned upwards of $1.5 million for&nbsp;Star Trek Into the Darkness&nbsp;and more than $3 million for&nbsp;Star Trek Beyond. He allegedly made another $3 million for&nbsp;Unstoppable&nbsp;and $5 million for&nbsp;This Means War, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p id=par-9_47>While Gadot’s $10 million&nbsp;Wonder Woman 1984&nbsp;payday has been confirmed, there’s no report as to how much Pine made. Though with multi-million salaries in the past, it’s unlikely he made less than previous projects. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Pine is worth approximately $30 million as of December 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwqb7IrGSpoZ6aeq%2Bx02auqKqknXq0rcuaqbJlp6S7pbHRZq6opZGjenKFl21loaydoXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
