Among those is Hobart “Hobie” Brown, who quickly became a fan favorite among <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">all the Spider-People</a> that appeared in the trilogy’s second installment.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>With a defiant spirit and affinity for chaos, rule-breaking, and non-conformity, this character perfectly embodies his alias, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Punk</a>. He’s not the type of superhero that folks typically see on screen — in fact, he very much opposes being called a hero at all — but he’s exactly the kind of person that Miles Morales needs in his corner. He’s smart, bold, and loyal (at least, to those he chooses to ally himself with).</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>All this is to say that Hobie made quite the impression on the audience, but while his personality might give off the impression that he’s a rebellious teen, Hobie’s age has been a subject of confusion among viewers. There’s definitely something about him that makes him seem older than Miles or Gwen, but he surely can’t be that much older, right? So how old is he, exactly?</p><h2 id=h-what-is-hobie-s-age-in-spider-man-across-the-spider-verse data-injectable=false>What is Hobie’s age in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spider-punk-in-across-the-spider-verse.jpg><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false>With Miles being 15, there’s no question that Hobie is older, however, it’s hard to say exactly by how much. According to Kemp Powers, one of the movie’s directors, at an initial stage, when concept ideas were still being thrown around, Spider-Punk was supposed to be 19 or 20. However, the filmmakers later decided to leave that factor up for interpretation.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=737 data-injectable=true>Because of this, there is no concrete answer to the mystery of Hobie’s age, but it’s generally accepted by the fans that he’s somewhere between 16 and 20 years old. The fact that the character mentions going to pubs puts the bar a little higher, at 18, which is the legal drinking age in the U.K., Hobie’s country of origin in the film.</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>That said, knowing Spider-Punk’s disregard for rules and figures of authority, this fact can be easily dismissed, as there’s a chance that he might attend pubs regardless of his age. After all, no matter how intensely laws may be enforced, surely we are all aware that there are ways to fool the system, especially when you’re an enhanced human with spider-like abilities. Good thing that Hobie never claimed to be a role model.</p><p data-characters=72 data-current-count=72 data-injectable=false>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is now <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">available to watch digitally</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXaS5pXnIrGShp5Kesm6u0aiup2WZo3q0vMidnKtlnZa7bq3Cq6asq12ptaZ50qmgnZ2iYsOmvtKeZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
