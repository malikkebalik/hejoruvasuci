The fighter and Head of the Class star tied the knot in 1988. But not long after saying “I do” allegations swirled that Tyson was physically abusive and unfaithful to Givens. Their tumultuous union ended the following year. In his book titled Undisputed Truth, Tyson claimed that he still saw his ex from time to time after their divorce and described one encounter where he went to her house and saw Givens with Brad Pitt.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_68>“When Brad saw me standing there in front of the house, you had to see the look on his face. He looked like he was ready to receive his last rites,” Tyson wrote (per <a href=#>FanBuzz</a>). “He went all pre-Matrix&nbsp;on me. ‘Dude, don’t strike me, don’t strike me. We were just going over some lines. She was talking about you the whole time.’ … It was what it was.”</p><p id=par-6_71>The <a href=#>former heavyweight champ</a> then began seeing medical student Monica Turner who het met at Eddie Murphy’s New Jersey home. Following Tyson’s prison sentence, he and Turner got hitched on April 19, 1997. The pair had two children together. Their daughter, Rayna, was born in February 1996 followed by their son, Amir, in August 1997. Turner accused her husband of infidelity and after five years of marriage they too divorced.</p><h2 id=h-how-much-older-is-the-boxer-than-spicer>How much older is the boxer than Spicer?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Mike-Tyson-kisses-wife-Lakiha-Kiki-Spicer-on-the-cheek-at-HBOs-Golden-Globe-Awards-afterparty.jpg><p id=par-7_21>The third time was the charm for the Hangover actor who walked down the aisle with Spicer on June 9, 2009.</p><p id=par-8_47><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sun</a> noted that Spicer was born in Philadelphia in 1977.

When I was younger, I viewed them as pleasure. Now that I’m older, I look at them as the half. It makes me realize that I’m a man. And at this stage in my life, they’re my teachers. If a man doesn’t have a little bit of fear of his wife, he’s not living his life right.”</p><h2 id=h-how-many-children-they-have-together>How many children they have together</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Mike-Tyson-C-poses-withL-R-his-son-Morocco-mother-in-law-Rita-Ali-wife-Lakiha-Spicer-and-daughter-Milan-Tyson-at-the-100-Women-Matter-Luncheon.jpg><p id=par-10_76>Spicer and Tyson have two children together.
