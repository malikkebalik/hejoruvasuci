Tito Jackson is best known as a member of the pop band the Jackson 5 with his brothers Michael, Jermaine, Jackie, and Marlon. Among the most popular musical acts of the 1960s and 70s, the group released such hit songs as "I Want You Back," "ABC," "I'll Be There," and "Enjoy Yourself." In 2003, Jackson embarked on a solo career as a blues musician.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Tito Jackson was born as Toriano Jackson on October 15, 1953 in Gary, Indiana as the third of nine children of <a href=#>Katherine Jackson</a> and <a href=#>Joseph Jackson</a>, both musicians. His siblings are <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a>, <a href=#>Marlon</a>, <a href=#>Jackie</a>, <a href=#>Jermaine</a>, Randy, <a href=#>Rebbie</a>, <a href=#>La Toya</a>, and <a href=#>Janet Jackson</a>. When he was ten years old, Tito was caught playing his father's guitar when he broke a string. His father fixed the string and demanded that his son play for him. Tito was subsequently gifted his own guitar.</p><h2 id=jackson-5><strong>The Jackson 5</strong></h2><p>Impressed by Tito's guitar playing and Jackie and Jermaine's singing voices, Joe Jackson encouraged his boys to form a music group. The three were soon joined by their brothers Michael and Marlon, forming the group the Jackson Brothers. At first, the group performed at their school and in supermarkets, and then began performing in local talent shows and at clubs on the Chitlin' Circuit. In 1965, they changed their name to the Jackson 5; they went on to perform at such major venues as Chicago's Regal Theater and New York City's Apollo Theater. With the help of their father, the boys secured a recording contract with Gary, Indiana's Steeltown Records in late 1967. The Jackson 5 went on to release their debut single, "<a href=# title="Big Boy Net Worth">Big Boy</a>," early the next year.</p><p>The Jackson 5 rose to superstardom in late 1969 after signing with Motown Records. Through the label, they recorded numerous hit songs, including the consecutive number-one singles "I Want You Back," "ABC," "The Love You Save," and "I'll Be There." Within a year, the Jackson 5 released four albums and supplanted the Supremes as Motown's best-selling act. They continued their commercial success with such singles as "Mama's Pearl" and "Sugar Daddy." However, the Jackson 5 soon began falling out of popularity, and got into a conflict with Motown over royalties. In 1976, the group signed with CBS Records and began starring on the television variety show "The Jacksons." The Jackson 5 had a handful of hit songs over the subsequent years. In 1989, the remaining quartet of Tito, Jackie, Jermaine, and Randy released their final album, "2300 Jackson Street." The Jackson 5 were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-159299 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Tito-Jackson.jpg alt="Tito Jackson" width=594 height=472 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-159299 class=wp-caption-text>Zak Hussein/Getty Images</p><h2 id=solo-career><strong>Solo Career</strong></h2><p>Jackson launched his solo career in 2003 as a blues musician.
