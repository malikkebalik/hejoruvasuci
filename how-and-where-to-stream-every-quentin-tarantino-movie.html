From his self-imposed 10-film limit to his unique referential, audacious style and themes, he has built an incredibly intentional and condensed must-see catalog for any cinema lover.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=489 data-current-count=489 data-injectable=true>From cult classic Pulp Fiction, to controversial Django, per his own count, Tarantino has nine feature films to his name. They aren’t the easiest to find online, however, if you’re not willing to go the old-fashioned way and buy or rent instead of streaming them. As of right now, the nine movies are scattered all over various streaming platforms, even if they’re all available to rent or buy via big streamers like Prime Video, AppleTV, Google Play, Youtube, and Vudu.</p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=101 data-injectable=false>In order to make it easier for you, though, here is how you can stream every Quentin Tarantino movie.</p><h2 id=h-reservoir-dogs-1992 data-injectable=false>Reservoir Dogs (1992)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>Tarantino’s debut feature film, Reservoir Dogs, is available to stream on Starz (which you can access via Hulu or Philo, as well) and DirectTV. This neo-noir dark comedy about a heist gone wrong was Tarantino’s shy entry into the big leagues before exploding with Pulp Fiction two years later.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Pulp Fiction (1994)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>Arguably Tarantino’s most famous film, Pulp Fiction can be streamed on HBO Max, DirectTV, as well as TNTdrama, TBS and TruTV’s websites and apps. With one of the most iconic casts in Hollywood history, Pulp Fiction catapulted him to worldwide fame and has been named one of the greatest modern films ever made.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jackie Brown (1997)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=623 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>You can stream Tarantino’s homage to Blaxplointation cinema, Jackie Brown, on HBO Max and DirectTV. The movie is credited with reviving Pam Grier’s career. After becoming an icon of ’70s Blaxploitation films, she was chosen to play Jackie Brown, a flight attendant who gets caught smuggling money.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) & Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>Both movies can be streamed through Showtime, which can be accessed via Prime Video, Roku, or Paramount Plus. You can also find Kill Bill on FuboTV and DirectTV. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The two volumes will be available to stream on Peacock on Dec. 1</a>. Any confusion about Tarantino’s personal film count usually comes from the fact that the director counts the two volumes of Kill Bill as a single movie since the two form a single story. Kill Bill borrows from westerns and martial arts films to create one of the coolest action films ever made.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Death Proof (2007)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>Death Proof can also be streamed on Showtime, through Paramount Plus, or on Tubi. This movie was initially released as a double feature called Grindhouse which also included Robert Rodriguez’s Planet Terror. It’s a thriller heavily influenced by exploitation cinema and about a stunt man who kills women with his “death proof” car.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Inglourious Basterds (2009)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>Inglourious Basterds is only available to stream on DirectTV or Sling, otherwise you can buy or rent it.

It’s set during World War II in Nazi Germany and stars Brad Pitt, Mélanie Laurent, Christoph Waltz, and many others.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Django Unchained (2012)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=740 data-injectable=true>You can find Django Unchained on FuboTV, Tubi, or DirectTV. This Jamie Foxx-led modern western is another revisionist movie set in the Old West. Foxx is Django, a slave who trains under a German bounty hunter played by Christoph Waltz.

In this “dramedy” set in late-1960s Hollywood, Leonardo DiCaprio plays a washed-up actor, Brad Pitt is his stunt double, and Margot Robbie is real-life actress Sharon Tate, who was murder by members of Charles Manson’s cult.
