From brilliant billboards to tantalizing trailers, the latest season was well-hyped as fans sat on the edge of their seats waiting for it to land on Netflix. One of the more traditional marketing aspects of the series were the time-honoured character posters, but some fans are wondering why this particular character got her own poster.</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Am I the only one confused as to why Karen got her own poster?

She simply seemed to be reactionary and didn’t even speak up to defend her son after Jason accused his club of satanic rituals. It is certainly confusing when a more prominent character, Tom Wlaschiha’s Dimitri “Enzo” Antonov, didn’t receive one despite having quite a bit of screentime.</p><p data-characters=114 data-current-count=114 data-injectable=false>Fans seem to think that the only reason she has her own poster is thanks to the actress having a fantastic agent.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>manmanchuck44’s comment from discussion "Am I the only one confused as to why Karen got her own poster?

Whatever the reason, the artwork looks great and the actress, Cara Buono, is probably thrilled with it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0wNGapaCdomLBqbXNoKpmnpGjwG691J6qraGfo3q4tNhmpqedXZi1or7AnKueql2cvLV506GcoqpdpMSvec%2Boqq2domQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
