His first film role was actually in the film that shot his brother to fame, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Home Alone</a>, where he played Kevin McCallister’s cousin, Fuller McCallister. He was only seven years old at the time and had only the briefest of moments on screen. He also reprised his role in Home Alone 2, again, with only a small part.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=247 data-injectable=false>He appeared in a number of films throughout the ’90s including the Father of the Bride duology, the rom-com She’s All That, and Music of the Heart. He then took a break from acting to attend private school, only to return years later.</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>Culkin noted the way that fame had treated his brother, telling <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Esquire</a> that “he was little and having to try to accept that level of fame as reality” making him cautious to follow that path, even choosing to turn down roles.</p><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>He made his way back to acting, a job he loved even if he didn’t like the fame that came with it, starring in a number of independent films, as well as the cult classic <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scott Pilgrim vs. the Word</a>. It has been his most recent role that has garnered the most attention, however, having played Roman Roy in the hit HBO series Succession.</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>It saw him nominated for a Best Supporting Actor award at the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards and winning the award at the Critics’ Choice Television Awards.</p><h2 id=h-kieran-culkin-s-height data-injectable=false>Kieran Culkin’s height</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kieran-culkin-succession.png><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=679 data-injectable=true>Culkin would be considered a “short king”, standing at 5 feet and 5 inches (168 cm) tall, especially when standing next to co-star Matthew Macfayden who stands at 6 feet and 2 inches (191 cm). There are plenty of shorter men in Hollywood, with prime examples being action-man Tom Cruise, Spider-Man Tom Holland, Zac Efron, and Harry Potter himself, Daniel Radcliffe.</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>He has been married to his wife, Jazz Charton, since 2013, and they have two children together, a daughter born in 2019 and a son born in 2021.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season four of Succession turned out to be the last of the series</a>, with the last episode airing in May of 2023. You can catch Culkin throughout the show on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Max</a>.
