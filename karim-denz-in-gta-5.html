He will also not sound confident while guiding Franklin. In the Loud approach he will drop some of the jewelry, not making it possible to get the maximum cash from the heist.</p><p dir=ltr>The Bureau Raid - If chosen as a crew member for the first time, in the roof approach of this heist, Karim Denz will arrive in a Burrito and the crew will have to lose a 4-star wanted level before going ahead with the mission. He also arrives late, forcing Michael, Franklin and the gunman to hold off the police until he arrives. If he has previous experience from the Jewel Store Job, he will arrive on time in an Ambulance and there will be no need to lose any cops while escaping.</p><p dir=ltr>The Big Score - If chosen for the first time, in the subtle approach of this heist as the first driver, he will drop some gold bars while trying to load the Gauntlets. Also, during the chase he will get caught by the cops which will result in one-fourth of the gold being lost, unless Franklin kills all the policemen who have blockaded him. If he has previous experience there will be no such consequences. If chosen as the second driver he will change the tires of the Stockade easily but will make it difficult for the player to load the car on as he will swerve side to side, however with previous experience this will not happen.</p><p dir=ltr>If chosen for the first time in the obvious approach as the first driver, he will crash into one of the wind turbines in the wind farm and die, dropping half of the gold. With previous experience he will reach the train with no problem as long as Trevor keeps the helicopter steady helping Lester to destroy the Merryweather Buzzards before they destroy his helicopter, killing him, and losing half of the gold. As the driver of the train, there will be no consequences, regardless of experience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b7%2FPqKmtq5uasqWtjZympmeXqa5wt8CroKZllJq7u3nIp2SgrJFigg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
