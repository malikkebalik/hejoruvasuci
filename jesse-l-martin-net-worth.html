Martin is an actor and singer who has a net worth of $8 million. Jesse L. Martin is best known for playing Tom Collins in the stage musical "Rent" and NYPD Detective Ed Green on the television police procedural series "Law & Order." He appeared in 198 episodes of "Law & Order," <a href=#>Dick Wolf's</a> original series that has since turned into a massive franchise. He has also had substantial roles on such television shows as "Ally McBeal," "The Philanthropist," "The Flash," and "The Irrational." On the big screen, Martin's credits include "Restaurant," "Joyful Noise," and "Sexual Healing.</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Jesse L. Martin was born as Jesse Lamont Watkins on January 18, 1969 in Rocky Mount, Virginia as the third of four sons of Virginia, a college counselor, and Jesse Sr., a truck driver. His parents ended up divorcing, and he adopted the surname of his stepfather after his mother remarried. The family eventually moved to Buffalo, New York, where Martin felt out of place due to his Southern accent. Concerned, an educator encouraged him to join an after-school drama program, and cast him in a production of "The Golden Goose." His performance was a big hit, helping him come out of his shell. Martin went on to attend the Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts. For his higher education, he went to New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where he majored in theater.</p><h2 id=theater-career><strong>Theater Career</strong></h2><p>After graduating from NYU, Martin toured the country with John Houseman's the Acting Company.

Martin got his big break in 1996 when he originated the role of gay philosophy professor and computer geek Tom Collins in Jonathan Larson's musical "Rent." A modern-day update of Puccini's "La Boh√®me," the musical was a stratospheric hit, earning four Tony Awards and a Pulitzer Prize, among other honors. Martin reprised his role as Tom Collins when "Rent" played on the West End in 1998.</p><p>Following "Rent," Martin appeared on the concept album of the musical "Bright Lights, Big City."

He reprised his role from the former play when it transferred to Broadway for a limited engagement in late 2010. Two years later, Martin participated in a one-night-only reading benefit of "Romeo and Juliet" to honor the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Delacorte Theater in Central Park.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-165416 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/GettyImages-490843387.jpg alt="Jesse L.
