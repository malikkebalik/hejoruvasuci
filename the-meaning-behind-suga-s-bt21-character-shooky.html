Even if he was initially inspired by his family dog, Suga’s BT21 character still has plenty of personality and meaning. Here’s what we know about Shooky and the <a href=#>BTS</a> member’s creative process.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-the-bts-members-each-created-bt1-characters-with-line-friends>The BTS members each created BT1 characters with Line Friends</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bts-Suga-V-The-Chosunilbo-JNSImazins-via-Getty-Image.jpg><p id=par-2_32>As the world’s biggest boy band, BTS has some impressive brand deals, recently becoming the brand ambassador for Louis Vuitton. For years, though, this K-pop group had a partnership with Line Friends.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_21>They created these colorful cartoon characters, known collectively as BT21. These characters then appeared on humidifiers, keyboards, keychains, headbands, and more.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_39>This collaboration was extra unique because the BTS members created their own characters. That includes RJ (Jin), Chimmy (Jimin), Cooky (Jungkook), Mang (J-Hope), V (Tata), and Koya (RM). These artists also created Van, the BT21 figure that represents ARMY.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_30>Suga created a brown circular figure who he affectionately named Shooky. (No relation to Jungkook’s Cooky, with a name inspired by Jungkook’s nickname. Although these characters are reportedly best friends.)&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>Suga first modeled his BT21 character after his dog</h2><p id=par-6_43>In one 2017 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> created with BT21, Suga started a poodle, explaining to one designer that it was inspired by <a href=#>his own dog</a> named Holly. As the first one to finish, Jimin created a dog character complete with a bowtie and floppy ears.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_43>“Don’t you have characters roughly set up for this kind of thing,” Suga asked, according to a translation on the video, ditching his poodle concept. “Normally, the outline is ready, and we just… Maybe we will end up just having an art class.”</p><p id=par-8_44>After saying that he drew five characters so far, Suga concluded that “creating is tough.” In a separate YouTube <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a>, the BTS members presented their creations. When it was time for Suga’s sketches, the members noticed that it looked eerily similar to Jin’s alpaca.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_38>Eventually, Suga settled on his cookie-inspired shape. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Metro</a>, this character has an attitude and a strong dislike of milk. Several facial expressions resembled his initial drawings, even if they weren’t on a brown dog like Holly.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>ARMYs wear BT21 merchandise to concerts</h2><p id=par-10_44>As an added way to share admiration for their biases, some ARMYs sport BT21-themed outfits and accessories for concerts. That includes handmade Shooky <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">merchandise</a>. For one concert at Citi Field, <a href=#>J-Hope</a> even noticed a fan wearing a Mang headband and gifted her his bag.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_31>Even some BTS members sport BT21 products at their concerts. That includes Jin, who had an RJ clinging to his back for part of a Permission to Dance on Stage concert.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_50>These wouldn’t be the only BTS-themed merch products available to fans. The K-pop group even inspired the “House of BTS” pop-up shop in Seoul. Music by BTS, including the Map of the Soul: 7 song, titled “Interlude: Shadow,” is available for streaming on Spotify, Apple Music, and most major platforms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvtb%2BMppyappmjtG6uxKGgp5xdqMKordJmma1qYWKwqa3RmpqtnaJiwKm7zqSwZ6Ckorlw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
