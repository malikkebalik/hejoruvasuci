Or The Popular Rapper (Who Also Used To Be</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p class=p1>When it comes to establishing ownership of particular works of art, music, film, dance, writing and theater, it can sometimes get really messy.&nbsp; Different artists will have similar ideas at the same time, as if there was something in the water that suddenly spawned greatness.&nbsp; Multiple musicians will build songs off of the same hook, or lyrical phrase, even though they've never met and are continents apart.&nbsp; Authors will write best-selling books with the same title, but completely different subject matter.&nbsp; It can lead to some serious confusion for everyone involved.&nbsp; But what happens when it's not your work that is eerily similar, but your name and persona?&nbsp; This is the issue that <strong>"Freeway" Rick Ross</strong> found himself faced with, when rap artist, <strong>Rick Ross</strong>, began to rise to popularity in the hip hop scene.</p><p class=p1><a href=#>"Freeway" Rick Ross</a>, also known as Ricky Donnell Ross, was born in Troup, Texas on May 3, 1960. He was first introduced to crack-cocaine when he was a teenager living in Los Angeles some time in the late 70s.&nbsp; An above-average tennis player, he hoped to go to college on an athletic scholarship.&nbsp; There was just one small problem. &nbsp;Ricky somehow made it through all 12 years of schooling without ever learning how to read. &nbsp;When his potential college suitors discovered this fact, every single one withdrew their interest and scholarship offers.</p><p class=p1>After his college plans fell through, one of Ricky's high school teachers suggested he start dealing drugs to make ends meet.&nbsp; He was good at it instantly. Pretty soon, he was outdistancing his teacher in terms of orders and profits.&nbsp; He began looking for a more direct source to purchase his cocaine from, and ended up hooking up with <strong>Oscar Danilo Blandon</strong> and N<strong>orwin Meneses Cantarero</strong>, a pair of Nicaraguan drug lords. He earned the nickname&nbsp;"<strong>Freeway Ricky</strong>" because he owned several properties along the Los Angeles Harbor Freeway.</p><p class=p1>At the height of his dealing, Ricky was <strong>selling $3 million in cocaine per day</strong>.&nbsp; Between 1982 and 1989, he is believed to have grossed <a href=#>$600 â€“ $900 million in cocaine revenues</a>, making <strong>$300 million in profit</strong>.&nbsp; Adjust that for inflation, and he was <strong>moving $2.5 billion</strong> and making <strong>$850 million</strong>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-194151 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/GettyImages-456969712.jpg alt="Freeway Ricky Ross" width=900 height=621 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-194151 class=wp-caption-text>Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images</p><p class=p1>Ricky had a major business operation spanning&nbsp;California, New York, Pennsylvania, New Orleans, Kansas, Oklahoma, the Carolinas, Washington, and Ohio, among many other locations.&nbsp; He poured the majority of his money into purchasing property, rather than living lavishly.&nbsp; He was worried that his mother would catch on to his less than ideal career choice if he suddenly started throwing money around.&nbsp; As with most drug dealers, it eventually all came crashing down.&nbsp; He was set up by his primary source, Oscar Danilo Blandon, and was arrested after attempting to buy 100 kilograms of cocaine from a federal agent.&nbsp; He was sentenced to life in prison in 1996.&nbsp; However, when it was revealed that Blandon was actually heavily involved with the CIA in the Iran-Contra scandal, and had given up Ross as part of an agreement to receive a reduced sentence of 2 years, Ross' sentence was eventually reduced to 20 years.</p><p class=p1>While still in prison, "Freeway" Rick Ross, began to hear rumblings about a rap artist named William Roberts II, who was calling himself <strong>Rick Ross</strong>.&nbsp; The rapper had taken on the persona of a former drug dealer who was now a rapper, and had signed with Warner Bros. Records. It should also be noted that prior to pursuing a career as a rap artist, William Roberts II spent 18 months in jail. But not in the way you are thinking. &nbsp;As much as <a href=#>Rick Ross</a> wants the world today to believe he's a hardcore gangster, prior to becoming a full time rapper, he was a correctional officer at a prison in South Florida. &nbsp;Rick Ross initially denied the rumors that he was actually a former prison guard. &nbsp;He eventually had to admit the rumors were true, after The Smoking Gun was able to connect his social security number to an employment record at the Florida Department of Prisons.</p><p class=p1>When "Freeway" Rick Ross was released from prison in 2009, he did his best follow the path of the straight and narrow and get his life back on track.&nbsp; He was, for all intents and purposes, fully reformed.&nbsp; He was also not particularly pleased about someone using his name and likeness to sell records. &nbsp;The rapper Rick Ross had also grown a beard that looked eerily similar to what the elder Rick Ross had been known for back in the day. So, Freeway Ricky took the rap artist, <strong>Warner Bros. Records, Universal Music</strong>, and <strong>Jay Z</strong>&nbsp;(the rapper's mentor and producer) to court, suing for <strong>$10 million</strong> in damages and an injunction to force the rapper to use a different name.</p><p class=p1>His first lawsuit, issued on June 18, 2010 was dismissed a month later.&nbsp; He refiled in California state court, and the case was subsequently appealed to the higher court in 2011.&nbsp; A new trial date was set for May of 2012.&nbsp; Again, the case was dismissed.&nbsp; Then in July of 2012, the California State court motioned in favor of "Freeway" Rick Ross, and a new trial date was set.&nbsp; By this time, the case was known as "Freeway Rick Ross versus Rick Ross and Warner Music Group".&nbsp; On December 13, 2013, the court finally definitively ruled in favor of rap artist Rick Ross, and his right to keep using the name Rick Ross under the First Amendment.</p><p class=p1>The court's reasoning was two-fold. &nbsp;First, the court felt that "Freeway" Rick Ross took too long to file his initial lawsuit.&nbsp; He'd known about the rap artist since 2006, but didn't sue until 2010.&nbsp; Therefore, his decision to sue in 2010, was deemed "untimely". &nbsp;Secondly, the court did agree that there was evidence to suggest that the rap artist had created his performing persona based on "Freeway" Rick Ross.&nbsp; However, the court had to uphold the rap artist's right to use the Rick Ross name, because "<strong>using the name and certain details of an infamous criminal's life as basic elements, he created original artistic works</strong>".&nbsp; He was not, in fact, "an imposter seeking to profit solely off of the name and reputation of Rick Ross".&nbsp; In a nutshell, if you steal someone's identity secretly, that's identity theft.&nbsp; If you assume portions of someone's identity publicly, with the full knowledge of your audience and those around you, the court is okay with it.&nbsp; It's a fine line.&nbsp; It's probably safe to say that while Rick Ross might be popular in the hip hop community, he doesn't have any fans in the "Freeway" Rick Ross' household.&nbsp; It's got to be tough watching someone make millions off of a part of your life you are doing your best to put behind you. &nbsp;Especially if that person is a former correctional officer and you happen to be a former 20 year inmate!</p><p class=p1>What do you think of the Freeway Ricky Ross vs Rick Ross lawsuit? Should Rick Ross the rapper have chosen a new name? &nbsp;Do you respect him less knowing he doesn't really have any credibility as a gangster?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJoqq2qkaO0pnnCmqqeZZansqbDwLJkq6GToHqzu9KsZK%2BrXae2pLeMq6asq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
