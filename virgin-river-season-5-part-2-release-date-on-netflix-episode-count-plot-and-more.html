We’ve been captivated by Mel and Jack’s romance for four seasons now, and with each ebb and flow of the path they share and the highs and lows that their friends and loved ones experience — it’s been an emotional ride. So when fans learned that the series had been renewed for both a fifth and sixth season, we were ecstatic.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>The first batch of episodes for season five is currently streaming, and while we’re still in the process of watching them all, we can tell you one thing — you’re going to want to cancel all your plans, curl up in a warm blanket with some tea or your favorite drink of choice, and binge watch each new episode.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>You might wonder why people are talking about part two of season two and when you can watch it. Is there really an extended piece of the puzzle that we’ll soon be able to enjoy? Don’t worry; as always, we traveled to the quaint seaside town of Virgin River to find out, and we’ve got you covered.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-virgin-river-season-five-part-one-is-streaming-now data-injectable=false>Virgin River season five, part one, is streaming now</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by @virginriverseries</a></p></figure><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>As we said above, you can dive into season five as Netflix dropped a batch of new episodes this morning. Fans of the series have been counting down the days until their debut, so we’re sure you’ve already begun watching the new season for yourself. If you’re still at work, don’t fret; they’ll be waiting for you when you get home.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>The first set of episodes contains ten new pieces of the&nbsp;Virgin River&nbsp;puzzle for fans to uncover, and we’re warning you now: they’re pretty emotional. There are some significant changes on the horizon, some beautiful and some heartwrenching, and without giving too much away, something otherworldly threatens the lives of everyone we’ve grown to love, and there’s no promise that survival is imminent for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>Fans will also see new faces in the quaint Virgin River town, and some of them are coming in to significantly impact the characters we’ve grown familiar with over the past few years. With an intricate storyline, there are layers to uncover with each new season, and as fans know, the series is based upon books of the same name — of which there are 16, so there’s a lot left to discover in Virgin River.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>When does Virgin River season five part two begin streaming?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by @virginriverseries</a></p></figure><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>If you’ve already begun your binge-watch-a-thon for season five of Virgin River, you might wonder when you’ll be able to tune into the second part of season five — and we’ve got your answer. Season five, part two, debuts on Nov. 30, 2023 — just in time for the holiday season, and with good reason.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>Everything we know so far says that part two of the fifth season will focus on the most wonderful time of the year. The great thing about a minor window of time between the two parts of season five is that fans are given the perfect opportunity to catch up on the series as a whole, and yes, we mean it’s rewatch time.</p><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>What better season than the fall to begin your journey through the ups and downs of Virgin River again?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How many episodes of season five, part two, will there be?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by @virginriverseries</a></p></figure><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=722 data-injectable=true>The second half of season five isn’t as lengthy as the first, but it won’t skimp on content, creativity, and Christmas. The two-episode part two begins airing on Nov. 30, and the episodes are holiday-themed. The titles of each episode are “The More the Merrier” and “Father Christmas” — and we can’t wait to celebrate the holidays with the characters in&nbsp;Virgin River.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>Fans will also recall that season six was also confirmed with the announcement that season five was on the horizon. While there is no time frame for a release window for even more new episodes, you can rest easy knowing they’re on the horizon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y3tdGgoKdlop7Dpr6MrJyaq5%2BjenZ5z5qprWViYr%2BmuMSaqp5llJbBpnnOp2SnnaSbuarEjJ6noqufmbJur86upa1loKG8tXnAp5tmpZ%2BnsnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
