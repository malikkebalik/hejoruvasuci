And that seemed to be the case for one <a href=#>season 4 boy</a>. However, Love Island USA fans are skeptical about Kyle Fraser’s absence, and they took to social media to explain why he might have left.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Love-Island-USA-Kyle.jpg><h2 id=h-love-island-usa-season-4-revealed-that-kyle-fraser-had-left-the-villa>‘Love Island USA’ Season 4 revealed that Kyle Fraser had left the villa</h2><p id=par-2_53>During Love Island USA Season 4’s Casa Amor twist, Kyle Fraser was one of the six men to join the six original women <a href=#>in the villa</a> while the other six original men ventured to Casa Amor. And during the few days spent in the villa, Kyle struck a love connection with Deb Chubb.</p><p id=par-3_50>Kyle seemed to have the same quirky personality as Deb, who felt like something was lacking in her relationship with Jesse Bray. So Deb took the leap and coupled up with Kyle at the re-coupling ceremony. However, she felt instant regret when she saw Jesse return from Casa Amor single.</p><p id=par-4_39>After the ceremony, fans saw little of Kyle, as Deb was trying to rebuild her relationship with Jesse. However, narrator Iain Stirling later confirmed in episode 23 that Kyle had left Love Island USA Season 4 for “personal reasons.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>Fans share why they think Kyle exited ‘Love Island USA’ Season 4</h2><p id=par-5_32>Before Kyle departed <a href=#>Love Island USA Season 4</a>, allegations of sexual assault and other inappropriate behavior involving the Islander surfaced online. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Decider</a>, multiple women came forward with accusations against Kyle.</p><p id=par-6_49>One Twitter user said, “I don’t watch [Love Island], however it was brought to my attention that this individual Kyle from [Buffalo] sexually assaulted one of my friends and gave her an STD. [Peacock] do you not screen your contestants that appear on your shows? This is absolutely disgusting!”</p><p id=par-7_16>Fans believe that these allegations might be why Kyle abruptly left Love Island USA Season 4.</p><p id=par-8_50>“Thank you Love Island producers or whoever decided to pull Kyle out,” one <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> user wrote. “It was the right call. I really appreciate you taking these accusations seriously and protecting the villa girls from someone unsafe. ‘Personal Reasons’ works just fine for me, as long as he is gone.”</p><p id=par-9_27>A fan said, “Good riddance! I’m so glad that he’s finally gone! Sending my full-on support to all of the women who spoke up with their truth!”</p><p id=par-10_50>“Hope Deb and everyone else were told about the allegations and were aware of why he left,” another person added. “Definitely not a huge loss to get rid of him though, Deb was obviously feeling Jesse a lot more anyways, especially after seeing him come back to the villa alone.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><h2>Who are the current couples in the show?</h2><p id=par-11_32>After Kyle exited Love Island USA, Deb re-coupled with Jesse.
