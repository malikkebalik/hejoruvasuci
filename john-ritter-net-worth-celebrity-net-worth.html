Brown/Getty Images</p><h2 id=three8217s-company-salary><strong>Three's Company Salary</strong></h2><p>In 1979, ahead of the fifth season, Suzanne Somers and Joyce Dewitt's salary per episode was raised to $30,000. Joyce accepted the raise, Suzanne did not. As the story has been told over the decades, Suzanne demanded to earn the same amount per episode as John Ritter. That amount is generally understood to have been $150,000 per episode. She further demanded to receive 10% of the show's back-end profits. Producers rejected her demands and her character was written off the show.</p><h2 id=theater><strong>Theater</strong></h2><p>Ritter starred as Claude Pichon in "The Dinner Party," written by Neil Simon," in 2000 at the Music Box Theater on Broadway. The play ran for 364 performances. Ritter won the Theater World Award in 2001 for his performance. In 2003, Ritter made his last stage appearance in "All About Eve," a benefit for the Actor's Fund of America and held at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles, California.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Ritter was married to actress <a href=# title="Nancy Morgan Net Worth">Nancy Morgan</a> from 1977-1996.

Sweating profusely, vomiting, and with chest pains, Ritter was taken to the Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center across the street (coincidentally, the same hospital where he was born) around 6 p.m. that evening. He was initially treated in the ER for a heart attack, but his condition quickly worsened. Doctors then verified Ritter had an aortic dissection and he was pronounced dead at 10:48 p.m at age 54. A private funeral was held in Los Angeles and he was interred at the Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills Cemetery in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles.</p><p>In 2008, Ritter's widow Amy Yasbeck filed lawsuits against doctors involved in Ritter's treatment at the hospital. The lawsuits against the center were settled out of court for $9.4 million. &nbsp;A $67 million wrongful-death lawsuit against two of the physicians, radiologist Matthew Lotysch and cardiologist Joseph Lee, went to trial. Yasbeck accused Lee of misdiagnosing his condition as a heart attack, and Lotysch, who had given him a full-body scan two years earlier, of failing at that time to detect an enlargement of Ritter's aorta. In 2008, the Los Angeles County Superior Court jury ruled that the doctors who treated Ritter were not negligent and not responsible for his death.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 1996 John paid $2.2 million for a home in Beverly Hills, California. John's widow Amy Yasbeck listed the home for sale in 2017 for $6.5 million.
