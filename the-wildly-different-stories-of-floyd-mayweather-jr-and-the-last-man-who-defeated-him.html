He also drew headlines after he pleaded to misdemeanor battery in 2011.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>While Mayweather is a notorious name, fewer people have heard of Serafim Todorov. But the Bulgarian holds a special distinction: he's the last person to beat Mayweather in a fight.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On August 2, 1996, Todorov defeated Mayweather by a 10-9 decision in a highly controversial bout. The two squared off during the semifinals of the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, GA.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mayweather ultimately lost, though the immediate reaction was that he possibly should have won. Even the referee of the match mistakenly </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>lifted Mayweather's hand in the air</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> in victory as Todorov was being announced as the winner.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-305111 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-488107019.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-305111 class=wp-caption-text>Harry How/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Since that fight, Mayweather and Todorov's paths have diverged. Mayweather won his first pro fight later that year. He put together a boxing career that spanned more than 20 years, retiring with a perfect 50-0 professional record after defeating <a href=# title="Conor McGregor Net Worth">Conor McGregor</a> in 2017.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mayweather has earned a ton of money along the way, too. The fight against McGregor alone earned Mayweather a reported $300 million. Over the course of his career, he generated about 24 million pay-per-view buys and $1.67 billion in revenue. Between fights and endorsements, he's made nearly $1 billion.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Meanwhile, Todorov's victory turned out to be his last career highlight. He won the world championships three times as an amateur but settled for a silver medal in the 1996 Olympics. After his fight with Mayweather, Todorov rejected an offer from a group of American boxing promoters. He believed he would have received more money from the Bulgarian Boxing Federation had he won the gold medal.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, his home nation barely supported him, and he tried to represent Turkey at the 1997 World Amateur Boxing Championships. Todorov and Turkey had a deal in place that would have paid him $1 million, but it fell through.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Todorov's amateur boxing career ended in 2003 and he's kept a relatively quiet life since. He and his wife both lost their jobs at supermarkets and sausage factories. Now, Todorov lives on a pension </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>that pays him</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> $435 per month.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It's a chilling story and a reminder that the world of pro sports can be extremely punishing. One moment you're on top of the world, and the next you're barely scraping by.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2fnmWnnrmluNhmm6Kelpq%2FprrTZqqtp6KesrR5zp9kn6SfrrFuucCyrp6ZpJ2ys3nJq2SappRiwamxjKWYrKxdoq6vedahpmaclZuyosDEnWShoZ1k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
