With the help of designer Margi Kent, Nicks put together her ideal look.</p><p id=par-3_35>“We came up with the outfit: a Jantzen leotard, a little chiffon wrap blouse, a couple of little short jackets, two skirts and boots,” she told <a href=#>The New York Times</a>. “That gave us our edge.”</p><p id=par-4_21>Nicks deliberately picked a look that she could wear for years to come. She wanted to remain consistent in her style.</p><p id=par-5_28>“I planned to still be doing this when I’m 60,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elle</a>. “I wanted to make sure that what I wore then, I could wear at any age.”</p><h2>She’s had a consistent makeup routine since she joined Fleetwood Mac</h2><p id=par-6_12>Like her fashion, Nicks has stayed highly consistent with her makeup look.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_25>“I love the same eye makeup,” she said in the book&nbsp;Stevie Nicks: Visions, Dreams, and Rumours&nbsp;by Zoë Howe. “I still have everything I had then.”</p><p id=par-8_33>This look draws inspiration from old Hollywood, particularly actors like Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo. She brushes a line of dark shadow into the crease of her eyelids, adding intensity to her look.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_31>“I’ve always done my eyes like that. To me, Marlene and Greta are just totally glamorous without people saying they were sex symbols,” she said. “They were just wonderful, classic women.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-10_23>Though Nicks now has a makeup artist to bring her classic look to life, she shared the color palette necessary to achieve it.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_78>“I did my makeup my whole life up until I was 30. When you’re lucky enough to have a makeup artist you make her do it! It’s just easier — I have more important things to think about than doing my makeup! I stick to a palette of browns, golds and mauves, and mauvey pink lipsticks,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a>. “Brand doesn’t really matter to me, as long as I see something I like — Chanel, Clinique, Lancome, Revlon.”</p><h2>Stevie Nicks has adapted parts of her beauty routine over the years</h2><p id=par-12_27>Though her makeup look has remained the same, she’s added a few new steps to her beauty routine. These days, she aims to keep herself looking youthful.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-13_62>“I stopped laying out in the sun when I was 30. Probably because we were doing drugs all night long and I was sleeping all day,” she said. “I use Crème de la Mer at night. I can afford it. Plus, I never go to bed with makeup on and I do a little massage thing two or three times a day.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAtbHVopxmppmYuLR50Z6tnpmcmrFuu8udZKGnnKHGuLvOnWSbnZGqwbp5z6uYnKyZmLJuss6lo6ivlZl6tLXNnJxmb2Coe6nAzKVm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
