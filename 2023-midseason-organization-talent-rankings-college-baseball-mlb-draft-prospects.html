Again.&nbsp;</p><p>Even after graduating catcher Adley Rutschman and shortstop/third baseman Gunnar Henderson—the last two preseason No. 1 prospects in baseball—as well as righthander Grayson Rodriguez, the Orioles remain atop our Organization Talent Rankings. They again have the game’s best prospect, with shortstop Jackson Holliday having an incredible first full season, flourishing in Double-A as a 19-year-old after the Orioles drafted him with the No. 1 overall pick last year.&nbsp;</p><p>Including Holliday, the Orioles have seven prospects in the Top 100. Most of that talent has come through quality draft picks, hitting on their early selections picking at the top of the draft, as well as a pair of fourth-round picks in second baseman Joey Ortiz and third baseman Coby Mayo. Now they finally have potential impact international prospects coming through the pipeline, with catcher Samuel Basallo a Top 100 prospect.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond the Orioles, the young talent coming up in the AL East continues to look strong, with the Orioles, Rays, Red Sox and Yankees all having farm systems that rank among the top half in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Below are our full rankings for every farm system in baseball.</p><p><strong>1. Baltimore Orioles<br>Top 100 Prospects:</strong> SS Jackson Holliday (1), OF Colton Cowser (11), 3B Coby Mayo (26), SS Jordan Westburg (32), C Samuel Basallo (48), OF Heston Kjerstad (49), SS Joey Ortiz (70)</p><p><strong>The Skinny: </strong>Entering 2023 the Orioles boasted the top prospect in baseball for a second consecutive year, as Gunnar Henderson ranked as our number one player. With Jackson Holliday the odds-on favorite to take that honor this offseason it will be the third consecutive season a different Orioles prospect has ranked as the best in the game. This speaks not only to the Orioles’ eye for talent, but their ability to develop players they acquire. While there’s enviable top-end talent on the Orioles farm, they also possess great depth, with recent graduations and trade deadline departures hardly making a dent in Baltimore’s stocked cupboard. With the emergence of Holliday, Coby Mayo, Samuel Basallo and Heston Kjerstad they have a second wave coming behind the recent arrivals.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Milwaukee Brewers<br>Top 100 Prospects:</strong> OF Jackson Chourio (2), OF Sal Frelick (25), C Jeferson Quero (33), RHP Jacob Misiorowski (37), LHP Robert Gasser (90), 3B Tyler Black (92)</p><p><strong>The Skinny: </strong>In the last six drafts, the Brewers haven’t picked higher than 15th overall. While other teams have premier farm systems because they have tanked and accumulated high draft picks, the Brewers have built a robust minor league pipeline as they’re set to make the playoffs for the fifth time in six years. They have hit Venezuela hard, with center fielder Jackson Chourio the crown jewel as the No. 2 prospect in baseball and Jeferson Quero one of the best catching prospects in the game. After graduating outfielder Joey Wiemer and second baseman Brice Turang, Milwaukee has more homegrown draft talent on the rise as well.</p><p><strong>3. Los Angeles Dodgers<br>Top 100 Prospects:</strong> RHP Emmet Sheehan (23), C Dalton Rushing (50), RHP Gavin Stone (67), 3B/2B Michael Busch (72)</p><p><strong>The Skinny: </strong>The Dodgers continue to pump out prospects from both the draft and international free agency despite consistently picking toward the end of the draft and having a tick less money in their international bonus pool compared to other clubs. After graduating a pair of Top 100 Prospects in righthander Bobby Miller and second baseman Miguel Vargas, the Dodgers still have a strong mix of Top 100 Prospects at the top of the system and a depth of breakout candidates throughout the lower levels.</p><p><strong>4. Pittsburgh Pirates<br>Top 100 Prospects:</strong> RHP Paul Skenes (4), C Endy Rodriguez (34), RHP Jared Jones (66), 2B Termarr Johnson (79)</p><p><strong>The Skinny: </strong>Pittsburgh added Louisiana State righthander Paul Skenes to a system that was already deep and had plenty of potential impact prospects clustered toward the top. Several of that group have already debuted this year, including Endy Rodriguez, Henry Davis (who has graduated from prospect status) and Quinn Priester. Pitchers Anthony Solometo and Jared Jones have also taken steps forward.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Boston Red Sox<br>Top 100 Prospects:</strong> SS Marcelo Mayer (15), OF Roman Anthony (19), OF Miguel Bleis (80), C Kyle Teel (93)</p><p><strong>The Skinny: </strong>With a lack of recent success by the major league club, Boston has found itself at the top of the draft more frequently than Red Sox fans would like. It has, however, yielded considerable fruit in recent years as Marcelo Mayer, Roman Anthony and Kyle Teel each represent a Top 100 prospect taken by the Red Sox in each of the past three drafts. The depth of the Red Sox system is strong, as the emergence of several pitching prospects—most notably Luis Perales, Wikelman Gonzalez and Yordanny Monegro—has changed the look of the system in just a few short months. The Red Sox are stocked with up-the-middle talent, as all of their top 10 positional prospects play in the middle infield, center field or catcher. This current cache of prospect depth is likely Chaim Bloom’s greatest achievement during his time in Boston.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>6. Chicago Cubs</strong><br><strong>Top 100 Prospects: </strong>OF Pete Crow-Armstrong (12), RHP Cade Horton (17), SS Matt Shaw (88)</p><p><strong>The Skinny:</strong> Big progress from top prospects Pete Crow-Armstrong and Cade Horton give the Cubs a pair of top 20 overall prospects. First-round college shortstop Matt Shaw joins an organization that has seen recent draft picks such as lefthanders Jackson Ferris and Jordan Wicks and third baseman James Triantos experience breakthrough seasons. Slugging outfielder Owen Caissie, hard-hitting catcher Moises Ballesteros and precocious shortstop Jefferson Rojas provide further upside potential.</p><p><strong>7. San Diego Padres<br>Top 100 Prospects: </strong>C Ethan Salas (6), SS Jackson Merrill (13), RHP Dylan Lesko (41), LHP Robby Snelling (42), RHP Jairo Iriarte (100)</p><p><strong>The Skinny: </strong>Considering how many prospects the Padres have traded in recent years—including a pair of current Top 100 prospects in Nationals outfielder James Wood and Brewers lefty Robert Gasser—it’s no surprise that the depth in the system is lagging. But the top of their system is one of the strongest in baseball. Catcher Ethan Salas looks like a potential star, while shortstop Jackson Merrill gives them a second elite prospect at No. 13 on the Top 100. They have five Top 100 Prospects, with a couple promising teenage outfielders behind them in Sammy Zavala and 2023 first-round pick Dillon Head.</p><p><strong>8. Tampa Bay Rays<br>Top 100 Prospects: </strong>3B Junior Caminero (5), SS Carson Williams (22), RHP Shane Baz (43), 2B Curtis Mead (60)</p><p><strong>The Skinny:</strong> Graduations, setbacks and injuries have thinned the Rays vaunted prospect depth, especially when it comes to starting pitching, but this is still an enviable system thanks to the development of Caminero and Williams, as well as solid seasons from players like Osleivis Basabe and Jonathan Aranda, who are just off the Top 100.</p><p><strong>9. Washington Nationals<br>Top 100 Prospects:</strong> OF Dylan Crews (3), OF James Wood (7), SS Brady House (61)</p><p><strong>The Skinny: </strong>This system is so top-heavy it risks falling over in a stiff breeze, but having Crews and Wood as a 1-2 punch with a now healthy House right behind them gives Washington an excellent starting point. Now the Nationals have to build out the depth to go with that top-tier talent.</p><p><strong>10. Texas Rangers<br>Top 100 Prospects:</strong> OF Wyatt Langford (8), OF Evan Carter (10), SS Sebastian Walcott (82), RHP Owen White (89)</p><p><strong>The Skinny:</strong> Texas boasts a system with two Top 10 prospects in outfielders Wyatt Langford and Evan Carter. The former was the Rangers’ first-round pick in this year’s draft and has already made it to High-A. Their biggest breakout star this year has been Sebastian Walcott, who signed in January and quickly made his stateside debut after just nine games in the DSL. He’s dealt with swing-and-miss issues but also has shown an incredibly high ceiling. The Rangers have also gotten the big league debut of righthander Owen White and a large step forward from first baseman Abimelec Ortiz.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>11. New York Yankees<br>Top 100 Prospects:</strong> SS Oswald Peraza (55), RHP Chase Hampton (56), OF Jasson Dominguez (62), OF Everson Pereira (77), C Austin Wells (83), OF Spencer Jones (84), SS Roderick Arias (95)</p><p><strong>The Skinny:</strong> The system has plenty of talent, as shown by seven players in the Top 100, but no prospect with obvious star potential. Each has shown flashes of impact but must make adjustments to reach their ceiling. While a good chunk of the Yankees’ talent is in the upper levels, shortstop Roderick Arias wowed evaluators in the Florida Complex League before a broken pinkie ended his season. Arias’ teammates in the FCL also comprised one of the most talented complex league clubs this season.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>12. Cincinnati Reds<br>Top 100 Prospects:</strong> RHP Rhett Lowder (51), 3B Noelvi Marte (52), Christian Encarnacion-Strand (74), RHP Connor Phillips (94)</p><p><strong>The Skinny: </strong>Even after graduating Elly De La Cruz, Matt McLain, Spencer Steer and others, this remains one of the deepest systems in the minors with an impressive group of prospects at the lower levels who look to step in where the recent graduates left off. This is a list where our ranking of 30 prospects doesn’t encompass everyone to keep an eye on.</p><p><strong>13. Cleveland Guardians<br>Top 100 Prospects: </strong>SS Brayan Rocchio (39), C Bo Naylor (44), 1B Kyle Manzardo (65), RHP Daniel Espino (75), OF Chase DeLauter (98)</p><p><strong>The Skinny: </strong>Cleveland is this high even after the graduations of three rotation pieces in Gavin Williams, Logan Allen and Tanner Bibee. Even without that trio, the Guardians have plenty of intriguing upper-level pieces, including shortstop Brayan Rocchio, who sits at the top of their Everest-like heap of talented middle infielders, and Kyle Manzardo, whom they added from the Rays at the trade deadline. Chase DeLauter has bounced back from multiple foot injuries to show everyone why he was a 2022 first-round pick.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>14. New York Mets</strong><br><strong>Top 100 Prospects:</strong> SS Luisangel Acuña (63), OF Drew Gilbert (85), OF Ryan Clifford (96), SS Jett Williams (97)</p><p><strong>The Skinny:</strong> The Mets exchanged Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer—and at least $70 million—for three of the Astros’ and Rangers’ top prospects who now rank as the top three future talents for New York. The Mets added a bevy of other prospects as part of six deadline deals and well-rounded prep shortstop Colin Houck in the 2023 draft. The organization has seen encouraging growth from pitching prospects such as Mike Vasil, Blade Tidwell and Christian Scott.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>15. Arizona Diamondbacks<br>Top 100 Prospects:</strong> SS Jordan Lawlar (9), OF Druw Jones (86), SS Tommy Troy (87)</p><p><strong>The Skinny: </strong>The D-backs are firmly in the middle of the pack with both their major league team and their farm system, headlined by a top 10 overall prospect in shortstop Jordan Lawlar. It’s otherwise a solid but not spectacular group beyond their Top 100 Prospects.</p><p><strong>16. Detroit Tigers<br>Top 100 Prospects:</strong> 3B Colt Keith (18), OF Max Clark (20), RHP Jackson Jobe (59)</p><p><strong>The Skinny:</strong> This is a system on the upswing. The health and development of Keith has played a large role and drafting high enough to land Clark sure didn’t hurt. But Jobe’s return to excellent form, Dillon Dingler’s development and the steady rise of players like Ty Madden and pop-ups like Justice Bigbie gives Tigers fans some reasons for optimism.</p><p><strong>17. Minnesota Twins<br>Top 100 Prospects: </strong>OF Walker Jenkins (16), SS Brooks Lee (27), OF Emmanuel Rodriguez (57)</p><p><strong>The Skinny: </strong>Royce Lewis, Edouard Julien and Matt Wallner have given the Twins big league club a boost. The system isn’t as flush after graduating them and dealing away Yennier Cano, Spencer Steer, Cade Povich and Christian Encarnacion-Strand at last year’s trade deadline, but the top 10 is still solid, even if the depth of the system has dropped off a little.</p><p><strong>18. Seattle Mariners</strong><br><strong>Top 100 Prospects: </strong>C Harry Ford (68), SS Cole Young (69), OF Gabriel Gonzalez (73), 1B Tyler Locklear (99)</p><p><strong>The Skinny: </strong>A system that graduated Julio Rodriguez and George Kirby in 2022 and righthanders Bryce Miller and Bryan Woo in 2023 still boasts four Top 100 Prospects, led by recent first-rounders Ford and Young. The Mariners are rich in young up-the-middle talent at the lower levels, including Michael Arroyo, Colt Emerson and Felnin Celesten. After graduating four-fifths of a homegrown rotation in recent years, the Seattle system is a little lighter on pitching depth.</p><p><strong>19. San Francisco Giants<br>Top 100 Prospects: </strong>LHP Kyle Harrison (35), SS Marco Luciano (64)</p><p><strong>The Skinny:</strong> Lefty Kyle Harrison and shortstop Marco Luciano are the clear top of the heap in San Francisco’s system, which took a small hit by losing outfielder Luis Matos to graduation. Lefty Carson Whisenhunt had taken a step forward this season before an elbow injury landed him on the shelf, and contact-machine Wade Meckler hit his way from High-A to the big leagues. They added Bryce Eldridge in the draft, marking the second straight season they’d used a high draft pick on a two-way player.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>20. Colorado Rockies<br>Top 100 Prospects</strong>: SS Adael Amador (21), RHP Chase Dollander (46), OF Yanquiel Fernandez (53)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Skinny: </strong>The conundrum around the Rockies pitching development only grew more complex this summer as three of the top pitching prospects in the organization had Tommy John surgery within days of each other. To their credit the Rockies have drafted and acquired a bounty of talented pitchers in recent years but none have yet to truly break out. International scouting continues to be the strength as a strong core of former international signees lead the Rockies top 10. What they lack is a potential star in the making as opposed to above-average regulars with upside.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>21. St. Louis Cardinals<br>Top 100 Prospects:</strong> RHP Tink Hence (29), SS Masyn Winn (30)</p><p><strong>The Skinny:</strong> With the recent graduations of Jordan Walker, Matthew Liberatore and Alec Burleson the Cardinals lost a little bit of their top 10 depth. With a string of injuries and poor performances by recent draftees the Cardinals Top 30 was backfilled by their recent draft and a flurry of trade activity at the deadline, but the Cardinals still lack potential above-average regulars outside Masyn Winn and Tink Hence. They have done well to shore up their depth over the last month, but lack the sort of impact players throughout their top 10 they’ve had in years past.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>22. Chicago White Sox<br>Top 100 Prospects:</strong> SS Colson Montgomery (14), LHP Noah Schultz (36), C Edgar Quero (78)</p><p><strong>The Skinny:</strong> Colson Montgomery and Noah Schultz give the White Sox two of the most talented prospects in the sport, and trade piece Edgar Quero helps them continue their search for their catcher of the future. The system also got jolts by adding lefty Jake Eder from the Marlins and Nick Nastrini from the Dodgers. Those two upper-level arms, plus several other deadline additions, gave the White Sox’s system a much-needed boost.</p><p><strong>23. Philadelphia Phillies<br>Top 100 Prospects:</strong> RHP Andrew Painter (28), RHP Mick Abel (40), OF Justin Crawford (81)</p><p><strong>The Skinny: </strong>The Phillies system has been hurt by trades over the last two years and a season-ending injury to righthander Andrew Painter, but they still have some exciting talent at the top and added to that group by drafting high-upside prepster Aidan Miller in the first round in 2023. There isn’t much depth in the back half of the system, but the organization has seen breakout campaigns from several players including righthander Orion Kerkering, shortstop Starlyn Caba and outfielder Carlos De La Cruz.</p><p><strong>24. Oakland Athletics<br>Top 100 Prospects: </strong>C Tyler Soderstrom (31), RHP Mason Miller (54), SS Jacob Wilson (76), OF Denzel Clarke (91)</p><p><strong>The Skinny:</strong> The A’s have taken a step forward this year, but it’s still not what you want to see for an organization with an extremely thin big league club talent-wise. There are some useful complementary pieces here, but it’s hard to say this farm system has the core of the next successful A’s team, whether that team plays in Oakland or Las Vegas.</p><p><strong>25. Toronto Blue Jays<br>Top 100 Prospects:</strong> LHP Ricky Tiedemann (38), SS Orelvis Martinez (58)</p><p><strong>The Skinny:</strong> The Blue Jays look like they swung and missed at the top of the 2022 draft as no player among their collection of high picks has established himself as a pro. Where they have excelled is with later-round picks with advanced plate skills, developing a group of those players in recent years, most notably Davis Schneider. The Blue Jays have a cache of future utility infielders but a real lack of everyday regular position prospects. Their pitching talent is led by a trio of lefthanders, including the shining jewel of the system in Ricky Tiedemann. They have a large contingent of talented relief prospects with loud stuff who could all fit into long-term bullpen roles in the big leagues.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>26. Miami Marlins<br>Top 100 Prospects: </strong>RHP Noble Meyer (47), RHP Max Meyer (71)</p><p><strong>The Skinny: </strong>The Marlins aimed high in the draft and landed two of the most talented high school arms on the board in Noble Meyer and lefty Thomas White. That duo slotted directly into the Nos. 1 and 3 spot in their system, sandwiched around rehabbing righthander Max Meyer. Beyond that trio, this system falls off quite dramatically, though they’ve gotten good seasons from outfielder Victor Mesa Jr. and infielder Xavier Edwards.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>27. Houston Astros<br>Top 100 Prospects: </strong>None</p><p><strong>The Skinny: </strong>After their first post-penalty draft looked to be a huge home run for the Astros scouting, the team traded away Drew Gilbert and Ryan Clifford, two of the best players in their 2022 draft class and in the entire system. This stripped the Astros of two high-end talents that likely would have moved them to the middle of the 30 farm systems. Instead they find themselves among the bottom five in the league again. Astros fans can take solace in the organization’s continued ability to develop players far beyond their prospect pedigree or rank.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>28. Atlanta Braves<br>Top 100 Prospects: </strong>RHP AJ Smith-Shawver (45)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Skinny:</strong> It bears repeating but the Braves have found themselves at the bottom of these rankings in recent years for all the right reasons. They’ve not only graduated several talented players, but they’ve used their prospect depth to trade for a bounty of stars. The recent draft looks to be a potential upgrade to a Braves system desperately needing reinforcements.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>29. Kansas City Royals<br>Top 100 Prospects:</strong> None</p><p><strong>The Skinny:</strong> Despite its ranking, this system is better than it was a year ago. Top prospect Frank Mozzicato has shown progress, and infielder Austin Charles was moved quickly out of the Arizona Complex League. There are some mildly interesting prospects at the lower levels, but Kansas City’s farm still needs several more infusions of talent to climb the ranks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>30. Los Angeles Angels</strong><br><strong>Top 100 Prospects: </strong>C Logan O’Hoppe (24)</p><p><strong>The Skinny: </strong>O’Hoppe looks like the Angels’ catcher of the future. First-round first baseman Nolan Schanuel, the Division I OPS leader this spring, acclimated quickly to Double-A. Both should support shortstop Zach Neto in Anaheim next season. But beyond that trio of young players, the cupboard is largely bare, especially after the Angels traded prospects Edgar Quero and Ky Bush to the White Sox for Lucas Giolito. Righthander Caden Dana and outfielder Nelson Rada are lower-level prospects who could pop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o63SnpmapJyWuqa%2ByJyYZ5ufony0wM6roJ6rX2d9c3%2BMpqCdq5WWwLC6jKipoJmenseiwMiopWaskaGyr8CMq5ino5mjtLR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
