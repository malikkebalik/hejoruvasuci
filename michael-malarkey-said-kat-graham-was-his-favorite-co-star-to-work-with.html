For eight seasons, the show told the story of Elena Gilbert, a girl from a small town, and the love triangle she found herself in with brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore.</p><p id=par-2_43>In the show, Elena and her friends discover that their hometown, Mystical Falls, isn’t as safe and comfortable as they thought it was. Since well before the 1800s, vampires, witches, werewolves, and other supernatural beings have been a part of the town’s history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kat-Graham-Michael-Malarkey-.jpg><p id=par-3_41>TVD featured a skilled and attractive group of actors, which caused viewers to split into factions over the show’s many love triangles. <a href=#>Michael Malarkey, one of TVD’s cast members</a>, recently revealed that Kat Graham was his favorite co-star to work with.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-michael-malarkey-and-kat-graham-played-love-interests-on-the-vampire-diaries>Michael Malarkey and Kat Graham played love interests on ‘The Vampire Diaries’</h2><p id=par-4_66>There were a lot of <a href=#>unforgettable couples on TVD</a>, and some of them stuck with us long after the show ended. One of those relationships was between Kat Graham’s Bonnie and Michael Malarkey’s Enzo.&nbsp;In Season 7, we see the couple together, but it is in a flash forward three years after Bonnie got in trouble with the Armory and Enzo stepped in to protect her.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_46>Enzo puts Bonnie up in a cabin, and the two get closer as time passes and eventually fall in love. Bonnie’s relationship with Enzo represents her most mature and profound love. <a href=#>TVD showrunner, Julie Plec,</a> expressed excitement about incorporating Bonnie and Enzo into the show’s universe.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_54>Speaking about the couple’s relationship in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Plec said, “I really love the idea of them together. Enzo has so much love to give but has been constantly disappointed by people in his life. Bonnie, always giving so much of herself to others, deserves unconditional, powerful, and selfless love. I love them together.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-michael-malarkey-said-kat-graham-was-his-favorite-tvd-co-star-to-work-with>Michael Malarkey said Kat Graham was his favorite ‘TVD’ co-star to work with</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-7_50>There are so many people involved in filming a TV show, and actors find it easier to work with some of their cast members than others.&nbsp;Malarkey appeared at the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Comic Con Scotland 2022</a> in October with fellow TVD cast members Daniel Gillies, Candice King, David Anders, and Kayla Ewell.</p><p id=par-8_32>At the convention’s Q&A session, one fan asked the <a href=#>TVD cast members</a> who their favorite co-star on the show was.&nbsp;In response, Malarkey revealed that Kat Graham was his favorite co-star, saying,</p><p>“For me, it was Kat because we had so much together, and we developed such a great working relationship. I really think we felt proud of the work we did on the show.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-were-mad-that-bonnie-and-enzo-didn-t-get-a-happy-ending-in-tvd>Fans were mad that Bonnie and Enzo didn’t get a happy ending in ‘TVD’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_84>After having his heart literally torn out by <a href=#>Stefan Salvatore</a>, Enzo died in the final season of TVD. His death inflicted so much pain and anger on Bonnie that her scream created a new dimension where he could come back to her. Later, Enzo begged her to release him so that he could rescue her as well as Lizzie and Josie. Bonnie then went on to see the world and keep her promise to Enzo that she would live her life to the fullest.</p><p id=par-10_51>Many viewers were not pleased with how Enzo and Bonnie’s story was told and how it ended. As one <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> user noted, the writers never made a genuine effort with Enzo and Bonnie. Damon and Lily’s connection with Enzo got more attention in the plot than Enzo’s with his love, Bonnie.</p><p id=par-11_35>Fans just wanted to see more growth between their favorite couple, Enzo and Bonnie, but it seems like their story was wrapped up fast so that <a href=#>Damon and Elena</a> could finally have their happy ending.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMr5imqJmnsm6wyJqpop2jYrqqr8eanKVlnZa5or7KnrBmo5Gpeqi%2BwKGYpmWWlsOwvsitnGabn2LAta3RZq6oqptixKrAx2efraWcZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
