For people who knew Fred well, that was true.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Eddie Murphy’s ‘Mister Robinson’s Neighborhood’ on ‘Saturday Night Live’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_44>In addition to his sketches of “Gumby” and Buckwheat from The Little Rascals, one of Eddie Murphy’s most popular performances is his imitation of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood. Murphy’s rendition of the kids’ program was a decidedly different take on the kindly PBS show.</p><p id=par-9_42>Starting with his play on the show’s well-known opening melody, “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?”, Murphy sang in his parody, ‘I always wanted to live in a house like yours, my friend / Maybe when no one’s home, I’ll break in!’</p><p id=par-10_29>Definitely not as kind or sweet as the original, Mister Robinson continued: “So come out with some folks and a smoke / You bring the stash, ’cause Robinson’s broke.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Fred Rogers thought of Eddie Murphy’s and others’ imitations</h2><p id=par-11_40>In a 1999 interview with the <a href=#>Archive of American Television</a>, Fred Rogers opened up about the various parodies and imitations of him and his show, including Eddie Murphy’s. He shared honestly about being flattered by some and outraged by others.</p><p id=par-12_31>“I remember going up to be on The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson and he said to me, ‘You know, Fred, we wouldn’t do these parodies if we didn’t like you.'”</p><p id=par-13_26>Rogers fondly recalled meeting Eddie Murphy, although the television host did not (or perhaps would not) offer an opinion on Murphy’s twist on his kids’ show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1190055061-1.jpg><p id=par-14_48>“Most of the [parodies] were done with very good, gentle humor, you know? Eddie Murphy did that “Mister Robinson’s Neighborhood” and I remember meeting him. And he just threw his arms around me the first time he saw me and he said, ‘It’s the real Mister Rogers!'”</p><p id=par-15_23>The television personality, who died in 2003 of stomach cancer, then discussed those moments when an imitation of him was not well received.</p><p id=par-16_84>“Now there have been times that I haven’t been very pleased about a certain kind of parody…This was on a local station somewhere. Evidently, this man, on an afternoon program, wore a sweater and sneakers, came on the air and talked even more slowly than I do. He said, ‘Now, children, take your mother’s hairspray and your daddy’s cigarette lighter and press the buttons and you’ll have a blow torch.’ Now, he thought that was funny, of course. We put a stop to that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6qr%2FTnqlmqp%2BcsrO%2FjKecop%2BYl7yztM6om2avmJbBbrLRnptmqp%2BcsrO%2FjKucmqScrnq1tM6unqGsXaSzbrHDnaCeZZ2qv7G02KxkrKacYrautdOaq6Knnqh6sLKMoaCmZpipuq17</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
