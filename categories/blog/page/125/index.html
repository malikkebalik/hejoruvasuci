And it was: Trout's $430 million contract is the largest guaranteed deal in professional sports. It'll likely keep him in L.A. for the rest of his career, and he'll obviously be set for life.&nbsp;But dig a little deeper and you'll see that, technically, Trout's contract isn't the largest of all time. <a href=../../../../mike-trout-signed-a-record-setting-deal-but-floyd-mayweather-still-has-him-beat-for-largest-sports.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../../the-guy-who-spent-what-s-now-800m-worth-of-bitcoins-on-pizza-gives-tv-interview.html>The Guy Who Spent What's Now $800M Worth Of Bitcoins On Pizza Gives TV Interview</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
