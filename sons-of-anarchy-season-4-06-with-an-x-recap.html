After some heated words, they all deliberate and The Sons are given a day to come up with the cocaine and the body of the person who did it. Clay and Jax believe that the only possible people&nbsp;that could have taken it are Juice&nbsp;and Miles.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>Back at the club house, Tara and Gemma find that everyone’s most hated porn star, Ima, has spent the night. After some words, she is told to leave. As Gemma and Tara head to the car park they find Lyla, who says Opie didn’t come home the night before.

After she leaves, Gemma suggests that Jacks makes sure Ima doesn’t ‘happen again.’ Outside the club house Clay finds Unser asleep in his truck, when he is meant to be tailing Tara. Clay tells Unser that he better come up with a solution to their problem, because if Clay goes down, so does Unser.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>Opie finds Lyla and confesses that he did sleep with Ima, but only to get back at Lyla after Opie found her birth control. Lyla admits that last year, she had an abortion.
