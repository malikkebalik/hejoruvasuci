Someone could have saved Yu "Martin" Xu a hefty $3.7 million if they had told him that, since that's how much he says he gave to a company called Royal Court Escorts in exchange for the sexual services of world-famous celebrities like <a href=#>Megan Fox</a>, <a href=#>Candice Swanepoel</a>, and the model/actress/singer known as <a href=#>Angelababy</a>. This message, of course, was not delivered, and Xu isn't letting little things like shame or embarrassment stop him from filing a lawsuit against the company. Here's an excerpt from Xu's lawsuit:</p><p><span id=ext-gen101>"It was agreed that if (Mr Xu) paid the sum of $3.7 million (the agency) would provide <a href=# title="Megan Fox Net Worth">Megan Fox</a>, Candice Swanepoel and 'Angelababy' as escorts for sexual services."</span></p><p>Xu says that a Royal Court Escorts phone operator told him that trysts with world-famous movie stars and supermodels could be his anywhere in the world, as long as he covered transportation and accommodation costs. After he paid a total of $3.7 million, he says he was stood up by the agency, and the sexual experiences of Xu's dreams never took place.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-200177 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-500343408.jpg alt="Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Victoria's Secret" width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-200177 class=wp-caption-text>Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Victoria's Secret</p><p>The payments were made back in 2014, when Xu parted with a $24,000 initiation fee. Over the course of the summer, he made several more payments totaling $3.7 million, and it's these payments that Xu is hoping to recoup in court. Now, it is left to <span id=ext-gen102>Nalwa Holdings</span>, the company that owns Royal Court Escorts, to defend against Xu's accusations, but how exactly they intend to respond isn't known as of yet. As for Megan Fox, <span id=ext-gen101>Candice Swanepoel, and Angelababy, they will presumably continue to make tens of millions of dollars in their show business careers while remaining unaware of Martin Xu's existence.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnC5wKdknKCZo65uv9SeqmaZpajBs63LopinZZWosLC%2B02aqnqqmnrCmecWaoKWhnpx6pbHLoq2eql2lv7C5yKycZquVrXquscaapWaen616pK3NnaCcnV2oxKK6xKmmnqRdlruoscuamZqaqWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
