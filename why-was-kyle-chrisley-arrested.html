He was booked on suspicion of aggravated assault Monday and posted $3,000 for his release from the Rutherford County Adult Detention Center.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Municipal Records for Smyrna, Tennessee</a>, Citation 23-S00188-01 listed that Chrisley has no prior violations, and his offense is recorded as aggravated assault. He has an appearance scheduled for March 28, 2023, at the Smyrna Justice Center, the court location of the town considered part of the Nashville Metropolitan area.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>Details of the arrest were limited at first, but according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>, a Smyrna Police Department press release reported that Chrisley brandished a “fixed blade” during a physical altercation with a supervisor where he works at a truck rental business. Even though it appears the reality star had no prior violations, he’s had his share of problems.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>Fans of Chrisley Knows Best are well aware that he was the estranged son of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Todd Chrisley</a> who fathered him during his first marriage to Teresa Terry, a marriage that lasted from 1990 to 1996. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Chrisley</a> is his stepmother whom Todd married in 1996 and remains married to this day.</p><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>Kyle Chrisley’s trials and tribulations were well documented on the show as he admitted to having issues with drugs. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Life & Style</a>, he has gone to rehab about 40 times, and in 2013, there was an incident where he was on a crack binge and threatened to kill his father. Their relationship was further damaged by Todd being awarded custody of Kyle’s daughter Chloe, which he accused the reality star of doing just for ratings.</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>He has since been able to reconcile with his father who is now serving 12 years in federal prison for bank fraud and tax evasion while Julie is serving a slightly shorter sentence for the same. It appears he and his father were able to put their past behind them after Kyle attempted suicide while battling with his own self-worth and feeling like his world was falling down around him. He recently posted on Instagram about the experience.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kyle Chrisley (@kyle.chrisley)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=true>Triggers such as having a father sent to prison shortly after making amends can cause a person to relapse — as well as manifest into further problems such as being arrested for aggravated assault.</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>If you or someone you know may be considering suicide, contact the <a href=#>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a> at 1-800-273-8255 (En Español: 1-888-628-9454; Deaf and Hard of Hearing: 1-800-799-4889) or the <a href=#>Crisis Text Line</a> by texting HOME to 741741.
