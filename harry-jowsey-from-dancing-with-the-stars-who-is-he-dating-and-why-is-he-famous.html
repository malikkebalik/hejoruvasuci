So when this season‚Äôs cast list included <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Jowsey</a></strong>, many had a similar reaction to his announcement.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>While reality TV stars are no strangers to the ballroom floor, especially those made famous through Netflix reality shows, Jowsey‚Äôs appearance marks the first appearance of a dating show contestant who wasn‚Äôt on The Bachelor or The Bachelorette. Jowsey became an international name in the reality TV game thanks to his appearance on the first season of Too Hot to Handle.</p><h2 id=h-from-netflix-to-true-love data-injectable=false>From Netflix to‚Ä¶. true love?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Untitled-design-11.png><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>The Australian hottie won over hearts when he lasted all 8 episodes of Too Hot to Handle, making his way through the 4-weeks of celibacy and bettering himself. Leaving the villa, Harry Jowsey seemed to have found the one after his time on the show. At the end of season 1, Jowsey was dating Francesca Farago.</p><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=true>Nearly a month after the cast‚Äôs reunion though, Farago posted to social media that she and Jowsey had separated. However in May 2021, Jowsey posted photos of the two of them to Instagram implying the two are back together. We know that wasn‚Äôt to last though, as in April 2022, Jowsey and season 3 contestant Georgia Hassarati got together. While they were off and on throughout 2022, the couple broke up for good in April 2023.</p><h2 id=h-reality-tv-magnet data-injectable=false>Reality TV magnet</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ingenuity Live (@ingenuitylive)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true>What‚Äôs probably most surprising about Harry Jowsey is Too Hot to Handle wasn‚Äôt even his first appearance on a beach-themed dating show. Jowsey made his first reality TV appearance in 2018 on the first season of the Australian dating show Heartbreak Island. He even managed to win that series as well.</p><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false>Since his time in the Too Hot to Handle villa, Jowsey made an appearance on the MTV web-series Match Me if You Can, where top reality TV talent all get another shot at love. Similar to his luck with his previous relationships, he failed to make a meaningful match through the show. Jowsey went back to his Netflix roots in 2022, joining team Too Hot to Handle on Floor is Lava.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=724 data-injectable=true>While the U.S. gets to enjoy his smooth moves on Dancing With the Stars, Harry Jowsey‚Äôs fellow Aussies will see how far he goes in The Amazing Race Australia during the show‚Äôs first celebrity-only season. Teaming up with Love Island Australia contestant Teddy Briggs, the two are competing to win A$100,000 for the charity Beyond Blue.</p><h2 id=h-pairing-with-the-not-so-newbie data-injectable=false>Pairing with the not-so-newbie</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Harry üßø (@harryjowsey)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=712 data-injectable=true>When Harry Jowsey makes his DWTS debut on Sept. 26, he‚Äôll be debuting a new professional as well. Rylee Arnold may be new officially to Dancing With the Stars, for her, it‚Äôs a family affair. Her older sister, Lindsay Arnold, has been a professional on DWTS since season 16. Rylee was even coached by her sister when she appeared as a junior ballroom dancer on Dancing With the Stars: Juniors in 2018.</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=false>Rylee is 11 years younger than her older sis, so she spent her childhood watching Lindsey hit the ballroom floor. She even got to watch her take home the Mirrorball Trophy in season 25 alongside singer and actor Jordan Fisher. Now the big question, will the younger Arnold sister get her own Mirrorball with Jowsey? Only time will tell as the new season premieres on Sept. 26 at 8pm on ABC and Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yprdGrsGain6zApsWMn6mopV2Zrq%2BvyKeeZq%2BZqbVuwMeeZKyskafAbsPHqGSiq12dsm6wwK2gp59dlruledahsGaho2K1pnnFmqSoraNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
