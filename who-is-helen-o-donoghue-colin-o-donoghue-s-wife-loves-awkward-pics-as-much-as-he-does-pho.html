Colin ODonoghues Wife Loves Awkward Pics as Much as He Does PHO</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>If you've been paying any attention to <i>Once Upon a Time </i>lately, you've probably noticed that Josh Dallas' Prince Charming isn't the only in Storybrooke guy worth swooning over — not by a long shot. Nope, Irishman <a href=# class=T3D>Colin O'Donoghue is definitely giving Dallas</a> a run for his money in the resident hottie department. O'Donoghue joined the cast in 2012 as Captain Hook. It was difficult time for me. At that point, <i>Once Upon a Time </i>had sort of spun out of control, plot wise, and I was left to cross my fingers and hope that O'Donoghue would be making one of his semi-regular appearances as the iconic <i>Peter Pan </i>villain. But then, because the world apparently <i>is </i>a wish granting factory, he was made a series regular halfway through the second season (which coincidentally corresponded with a significant up-tick in my viewing habits) and I've enjoyed watching him swashbuckle about in pretty much every episode since.</p><p>I'm sure I'm not the only one who took to Google to type in that most crucial of searches: "Colin O'Donoghue girlfriend" (you know, because that was<i> obviously</i> the only thing keeping us apart). Unfortunately, that search returned the most dreaded of results: O'Donoghue doesn't have a girlfriend — he's married to a woman named Helen O'Donoghue.</p><p>Sigh. It looks like none of us will be lucky enough to be Mrs. O'Donoghue, but that doesn't mean we can't learn a thing or two about the woman who is. Now, the O'Donoghues are apparently pretty private people, so details aren't exactly overflowing. But I think we're all up to the challenge.</p><h3>THEIR WEDDING PICTURES ARE A THING OF BEAUTY</h3><p>I'm perhaps willing to overlook the fact that O'Donoghue fell in love with another woman because they produced these wonderfully awkward wedding pictures.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>Perfection.</p><h3>SHE WAS HIS CHILDHOOD SWEETHEART</h3><p>They grew up in nearby towns back in Ireland (where they're both from) and have <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>been together since they were 18</a>. Now that he's 33, I guess we can take some comfort in knowing that we missed our window of opportunity more than a decade ago.</p><h3>THEY HAVE A BABY</h3><p>Their son, Evan James O'Donoghue, was born August 1, 2013. O'Donoghue announced the birth (and the pregnancy, which was unknown) via Twitter later than day.</p><h3>SHE DOESN'T MIND HIS "HOOKERS"</h3><p>His fan-base, that is. I assume she might take issue with the <i>other </i>kind of hooker. In fact, she seems to have a pretty good sense of humor about it. He told <i>Access Hollywood</i>, “She's like, 'Have you seen what they’ve said, here, about this, or that and the other,' and I was like, 'No.' I just say, 'Don’t look at it.'"</p><h3>SHE'S A TEACHER</h3><p>O'Donoghue is a man of few words when it comes to his personal life, but he did have something pretty sweet to <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>say about his wife's profession</a>.</p>Not to belittle what we do as actors, but my wife Helen is a teacher, and she makes a real difference to kids. So it's unusual to see people thinking of us as something special.<p>Say it with me now: D'awwwww.</p><p>The takeaway? O'Donoghue might not <i>technically </i>be on the market, but that won't stop us from doing this if we get the chance:</p><p><i>Images: <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Colin O'Donoghue</a>/Facebook (2); </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>welcomeaboardthenopetrain</i></a><i> (2), </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>fuckyeahpositivegraph</i></a><i>/Tumblr</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHx0gZNxZ2avmKR6qr%2BMoZylnZ5ivKW7zaieoa2VYrCwuMinZKicn6O8qLTUnqpmr5mbsm64zq%2BcrGWRrLi4rdGdZKmhk6h6or%2BMpqycoF2WwG60xGabqJ2j</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
