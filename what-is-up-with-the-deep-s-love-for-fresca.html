The Prime Video superhero ensemble drama/comedy follows along as a group of superheroes gets confronted by the Boys, a group of civilians who want to stop the superheroes. It’s a large cast, featuring a <a href=#>number of different characters</a>, so there’s constantly a lot going on.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_50>But, despite all the action, fans can’t help but focus on the little things — like one character’s seemingly unexplained obsession with a soft drink. That’s right, fans are hyperfocused on The Deep’s constant Fresca drinking in season 2 of <a href=#>The Boys</a>. So, what’s the deal? We have some theories.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is&nbsp;‘The Boys’ about?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-3_48>In contrast to the caring superheroes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe,&nbsp;The Boys looks differently at superheroes behind-the-scenes. In short, they’re all kind of jerks. As the show goes on, we learn that each of the superheroes of the Seven is doing dirty deeds in their free time.</p><p id=par-4_28>For example, the leader of the pack, Homelander, has pretty much the same powers as Superman, but he spends a lot of his time stalking and abusing women.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_67>The Boys are a group of vigilantes who are out to get rid of the superheroes. Some of them lost loved ones to the supes, while others just hate the fact that they have powers and think they can’t be trusted. The series follows along as a new member joins each group, showing if they are or are not able to adjust to their new group’s dynamic.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Deep has had an interesting storyline on&nbsp;‘The Boys’ so far</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Boys-Deep.jpg><p id=par-6_49>One of the shadiest members of the Seven is The Deep. The Deep is the superhero group’s token aquatic superhero, with the ability to breathe underwater and communicate with aquatic creatures. He is the vainest member of the Seven, constantly focusing on his Instagram page and flexing his muscles.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_52>In season one, The Deep convinces new member Starlight to perform a sex act on him by telling her he’s one of the most influential members of the Seven and can have her removed. He then goes on to mock her for it until she publicly announces she was sexually assaulted.</p><p id=par-8_21>The Deep then apologizes and is ostracized from the group. He is sent on sabbatical for an undisclosed amount of time.</p><p id=par-9_44>While on sabbatical, The Deep figures out he won’t be welcomed back into the Seven. As a means of coping, he joins a cult called the Church of the Collective. While in the cult, he seeks his own journey of self-discovery in <a href=#>season two</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>But really, what’s up with his Fresca obsession?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_32>While The Deep has a pretty strange storyline already, season two really makes it weird and adds in an obsession with Fresca. The Deep is constantly drinking it. Can after can. I</p><p id=par-11_44>t’s never talked about as a plot point or anything, and fans don’t know what to make of it. Is Fresca a sponsor for the show and this is all product placement? Is there something else in the Fresca can? What could it be?</p><p id=par-12_73>It turns out, all the Fresca is just to keep you wondering. <a href=#>Eric Kripke</a>, The Boys showrunner, reportedly alleged that the writing team has been using the Fresca as a play on the common trope of cult members “drinking the Kool-Aid.” To show that The Deep has truly started to go off the deep end, the show is using Fresca as a way to illustrate how cult-ish the Church of the Collective is.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_40><a href=#>Kripke</a> stated that the writing team settled on Fresca because they thought it was the funniest option for what non-alcoholic cult members would drink besides Kool-Aid. We can’t wait to see what other weird in-jokes fans will wonder about next.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMm6ayq12osqK%2Fzqdka2Wnna61ecisZK6oXay2tbSMrZ%2BeZZSasrG%2FjKWmr51dm7yzecWrnKybkWO1tbnLaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
