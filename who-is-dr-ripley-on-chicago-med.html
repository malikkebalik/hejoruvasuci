Suave, handsome, and instantly interesting, the character’s as-yet bare background is already garnering plenty of interest. In the premier episode, it was revealed that he and Dr. Charles have a history, and not a good one. It seems Dr. Charles was, a good 20 years back, Ripley’s physician, and in Ripley’s mind he was over-medicated during his time in Charles’ care.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>The dramatic intro of a new doctor into <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Chicago Med family</a> is stirring up the fanbase, as they theorize about where Ripley’s story will go and pick favorites for the remainder of season 9. The character’s actor, fresh off a stint in Big Sky, is quickly becoming a crowd-favorite, as he dazzles in his new role.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who is Dr. Ripley?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Luke-Mitchell-Chicago-Med-1.jpg><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>Dr. Ripley was only recently introduced to Chicago Med viewers, so we don’t know a huge amount about him just yet. What we do know, however, is that he’s a proficient emergency department physician with a complicated history.</p><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=749 data-injectable=true>Over the course of the season 9 premiere, it was revealed that Ripley experienced quite a bit of struggle in his youth. He and Dr. Charles met while Ripley was in a juvenile detention center two decades back, and Charles remembers the young Ripley as “violent” and “aggressive.” To combat his aggressive nature, it seems Ripley was placed on chemical restraints, or drugs intended to restrict a patient’s mental capacity and physical movement. They are still occasionally used today, but only in extreme cases.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>Ripley clearly still has trauma from the use of chemical restraints on him when he was just a troubled child, but he’s come a long way from those long-ago days in juvie. More details about the complicated relationship he shares with Dr. Charles are sure to emerge over time, as fresh episodes of Chicago Med season 9 release, and viewers can’t wait to learn more.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-who-plays-dr-ripley-in-chicago-med data-injectable=false>Who plays Dr. Ripley in Chicago Med?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Luke-Mitchell-S.H.I.E.L.D.jpg><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=180 data-injectable=false>Dr. Ripley is played by Australian actor Luke Mitchell. The handsome 38-year-old is already collecting fans in droves, as he emerges as a standout in Chicago Med’s latest season.</p><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true>That’s on top of the solid fanbase Mitchell already boasted, after years on the big and small screen. He’s been acting since the late 2000s, when he was appearing in shows like H20: Just Add Water and The Tomorrow People. By the mid-2010’s he was finding roles in even more prominent projects, including a stint in the MCU. He played Lincoln Campbell in Marvels’ Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, along with Blindspot, The Republic of Sarah, and Legacies.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>His new position as a vital character on Chicago Med only makes Mitchell more recognizable to a wide audience, and his growing popularity could lead to Dr. Ripley becoming a mainstay on the program. Only time will tell what the writers have in mind for the character, of course, but Ripley is easily interesting enough to stick around for at least a season or two.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmnKJiv6q8y56wZqeeYrCptcKanqhlnZqxcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
