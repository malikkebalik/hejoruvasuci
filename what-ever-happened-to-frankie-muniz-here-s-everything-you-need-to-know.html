Others, like Christopher Kennedy Masterson and Justin Berfield, have appeared in a smattering of other projects, but largely saw their stars fade after Malcolm in the Middle concluded its run.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true>The show’s star, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Frankie Muniz</a></strong>, seemed like the next big thing when the series ended in 2006. He was winning awards, starring in numerous roles, and cameoing in projects nearly every other week. Subsequent years saw Muniz largely fade from the spotlight, however, leaving fans to wonder what Muniz has been up to over the last decade and a half.</p><h2 id=h-what-has-frankie-muniz-been-up-to data-injectable=false><strong>What has Frankie Muniz been up to?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-22-at-3.12.02-pm-e1701792936508.png><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>Scattered reports have seen rumors regarding a number of Muniz’s supposed health issues spread widely. A few clips, taken out of context, led many to speculate that Muniz was suffering from strokes and memory loss, and this was to explain for his absence from popular media.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>The truth is a bit more complicated. For one thing, Muniz’s health isn’t nearly as bad as many would have you believe. For another, he never really disappeared. Muniz may not be starring in any prime-time series or blockbuster films, but he has continued to do work both within <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and outside of Hollywood</a>.</p><h2 id=h-film-and-television-projects data-injectable=false><strong>Film and television projects</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/malcolm-in-the-middle-frankie-muniz-e1701792971256.png><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>Muniz didn’t stop appearing on screen <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">after Malcolm in the Middle</a>, he just didn’t show up in as large of a role. He snagged guest-starring roles in a number of popular television series between 2006 and 2012 and continues to take roles to this day.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>Fans of shows like Arrested Development and Criminal Minds will likely recall Muniz’s guest appearances, but more recent years have seen the 38-year-old shift into <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reality and competition shows</a> like Dancing with the Stars, Dancing with the Stars Junior, and Total Bellas.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>That doesn’t mean he’s turned entirely away from regular acting, of course. In 2023, Muniz enjoyed a cameo in Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens, appearing as Shawn in “Too Hot to Survive.”</p><h2 id=h-racing data-injectable=false><strong>Racing</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-52609239.jpg><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>One of the reasons behind Muniz’s step back from the acting world has to do with his passion for racing. He got into car racing young, helping out with his first race back in 2001. Since then, racing has been a persistent activity for Muniz, who competed in several dozen races between 2004 and 2013.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>After taking a few years off from the track, Muniz returned to racing in 2021, debuting in his first ever stock car race in Bakersfield, California. In early 2022, he returned to stock car racing, helping to test out the ARCA Menards Series.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>By 2023, Muniz was promoted to racing full-time for Rette Jones Racing. He competed in the ARCA Menards Series in Rette Jones Racing’s No. 30 Ford Mustang, ultimately finishing fourth in the rankings. He enjoyed one top-five and 11 top-tens over the course of the season.</p><h2 id=h-music data-injectable=false><strong>Music</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=577 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>Music hasn’t been a massive passion for Muniz over the years, but he has dipped his toes into the musical world. He’s been in several bands over the years, showcasing his talent as a percussionist. He shifted into management in 2017, announcing via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a> that he is the new manager for Astro Lasso.</p><h2 id=h-health-issues data-injectable=false><strong>Health issues</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=321 data-injectable=false>Perhaps the most prominent headlines to circulate over the last few years have regarded Muniz’s health. He was hospitalized twice, almost exactly a year apart, in 2012 and 2013 from what was initially suspected to be transient ischemic attacks. TIAs are essentially mini-strokes, sparking concern in Muniz’s fans.</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true>Thankfully, this was a misdiagnosis. Muniz <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> in a December 2021 episode of the podcast “Steve-O’s Wild Ride” that he actually suffered from a pair of “aura migraines.” These, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he said</a>, mimic strokes, but are actually far less severe.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>Reports of supposed memory loss have also shadowed Muniz for years, another topic he addressed while speaking with Steve-O. He noted that his memory loss is not nearly as extensive as many claim, but that he does have “a bad memory.” The most likely cause of this, according to Muniz, is that he’s had “nine concussions.”</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true>More than anything, however, he believes that his selective memory loss is the result of doing “so f***ing much” during the early 2000s.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>“Of course I can’t remember all of it,” Muniz said. He was, in fact, starring in multiple movies, appearing as a guest star on several television shows, and doing the media circuits all while filming the last few seasons of&nbsp;Malcolm in the Middle. It’s fair to assume that he simply can’t recall all of those various details.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGZpGKyt7HRZp%2BaqKCau6awjK2mZp6ilrustcRmpK6mma96qbHRnqpmnaaav7rAx6KloGWppMJuusSem2asn2K4r7vWaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
